{"URBANST 156A": ["[0.95] [Autumn 2019] I LOVED this class and would recommend that anyone who is interested in getting a better sense of place and how places affect people should take it. I particularly loved how we got opportunities to connect what we learned to real-world places and issues. It's a great way to learn more about the places we come from.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Dr. Hwang is an amazing lecturer and scholar and it's very evident that she's familiar with and passionate about the subject she teaches and researches. This class is very manageable and provides a lot of cool insights into contemporary changes like gentrification and ongoing segregation in American cities. Please take advantage of your time and Stanford by taking this class!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] This class fundamentally changed the way I viewed cities and development. Lectures can be a bit dry, but the projects are fun and the skills you will learn in this course are super valuable.", "[0.25] [Autumn 2019] Pace work in the class. it is well paced and there is a lot of time in class to get some work done on big assignments. use it and", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] This course will teach you a lot the general forces at work in an urban American city. The final project is your opportunity to explore any city you'd like, so take advantage of that! Look at the readings before class even if you only have time to skim them because it'll make the discussions a LOT better.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2019] If you are interested in urban studies or sociology, definitely take this course. The workload was manageable, readings were really interesting, and the professor is nothing short of excellent. It is quite focused on the Bay Area and Chicago but does incorporate readings and discussions on other metropolitan areas, and coming out of the class, I have a much better understanding of the causes and consequences of gentrification.", "[0.3] [Autumn 2019] Take the class for sure, one of the more informative sociology classes at Stanford.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] This class is a really good learning opportunity for those with less of a strong background in methods and/or urban studies to engage with really important course concepts, but also really thoughtful   generative group-work with upperclassmen. Though some concepts may repeat others from core URBANST, this course is really well organized and allows for lots of flexibility in what you invest in it.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2019] Good introduction to understanding segregation, inequality, and the dynamics of modern cities. Some readings are dense and dry, but some are very insightful and useful.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] Professor Hwang is lovely! Her research is super interesting and the topics in this course are very cool. The final project is super interesting as well. You're probably going to come away with more questions than answers about gentrification, but the class discussions are very fruitful.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2019] terrifically well organized and a lot of data", "[0.2] [Autumn 2017] If you follow the readings, you will be fine. Even if you don't understand it, the real learning happens in discussion.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2017] Be prepared to really engage in the readings! Professor Hwang is a tough grader, but very nice and approachable-- so just make sure to start work early so you can go to her for help!", "[0.3] [Autumn 2017] Pay attention during section--especially when the TA makes you check on quality of data. ALSO, be clear headed and realistic about the kind of data you have access to and the time it'll take for you to go through it for the final.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2017] The topics in the class are very interesting. The class is a great introduction to urban studies because it introduces you to a lot of the key theories that are out on the phenomena of urban change. The reading load is high however, Professor Hwang is very receptive to changing anything that the class doesn't feel is working.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] Take it! It's a great way to learn about urban change and cities, which I think is especially important as students who are likely to enter the working world from a privileged and economically well off standpoint. Class made me a better student and citizen.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] It was a lot of work but it's an extremely informative class. You will know the ins and outs of gentrification (or at least have a solid foundation of the topic). The instructor and TA are very helpful and are very receptive to feedback. Great class just work hard!", "[0.55] [Autumn 2017] Definitely worth taking, I learned a lot. Just watch out about grading because the professor is very strict and sometimes you have to ask for clarification about expectations.", "[-0.3] [Autumn 2017] Pay attention to the details of the instructions given for the papers and midterm. The grading rubric is followed very strictly. Also, there are a lot of readings, so pay attention to the major themes.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2017] Definitely take it! It exposes you to the complexities in determining factors that create urban change. Also, gives  detailed information about the persistence of race in a lot of these issues.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2017] I would totally take this course if you're looking for an introduction to gentrification and immigration in urban cities. It's a good course for those interested in sociology and urban studies.", "[0.5] [Autumn 2017] The discussions in class are important to listen to and engage in", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] I think this course does a really good job about introducing multiple concepts regarding the change in American cities whether it is gentrification, immigration, or other phenomena. The instructor for this course is super knowledgable and is very supportive of the students. I think this class has been one of my favorites at Stanford. Only thing I would say is be prepared to do a decent amount of reading every week.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2017] very much worth it. takes a substantial amount of work but you come out learning a ton about urban change and the nuance that exists in a lot of topics like segregation, immigration, and gentrification"], "URBANST 158": [], "URBANST 163": ["[0.7] [Spring 2022] A great introduction to land use. Provides a general overview of every major topic influencing decision-making for land use, urban planning, zoning, etc. Workload was very manageable, and assignments were mostly short papers that were straight forward with an in-class simulation exercise to end the quarter.", "[0.55] [Spring 2022] This class provides a practical and incredibly informative look into local government and development. It is an excellent mix of theory and discussion from real-life working professionals.", "[0.4] [Spring 2022] Really exceptional WAYS. Should be a requirement for anyone living in an area with a housing crisis! Doesn't go over solutions, but parameterizes policy and implementation problems in land use exceptionally well. Also, really nice workload! Absolute must take!", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] This is a great and interesting class as an introduction to urban studies. I took it just as an interest class and learned a ton and it's cool to get a much better idea about the cities around us right here in the Bay.", "[0.85] [Spring 2022] Take the class!!! Such a great, chill class with an amazing pay off!", "[1.0] [Spring 2022] If you're just looking to get a requirement of some sort done, this class is fine. It's a manageable workload with fair grading. But if you wanted more than that, you might be disappointed. Every single class is just a new guest speaker (or set of speakers) who lecture on their topic for an hour and a half followed by a few questions from a classroom that has mostly spaced out. It's basically a speaker series class but with much more homework.\nThe best way I can describe it is, despite being an in-person class, it feels like a zoom class because every meeting is just us sitting and listening to someone talk with minimal engagement. I know the instructors wanted to show us people in the field, but it would have been much more effective to cut down on these super long lectures, invite less guest speakers, and make use of our class's small size to have more reading-based small discussions, group projects, simulations, etc. The best parts of the course were when we actually had something to do like the final simulation. This may have allowed the course to cutdown on busy-work assignments like all the reflections. I really liked the instructors as people and I get teaching isn't their primary job, but I still think more could have been done than just inviting a bunch of speakers.\nAlso the land use topics discussed are almost entirely based in California which is, again, a consequence of the fact that the lectures (and instructors) all work in development in California. This isn't bad in itself, but it's worth noting if you are looking for a more global or even national look at development.", "[-0.35] [Spring 2022] While I liked the course, I struggled a bit with the structure. There was often little to no guidance with assignments so oftentimes grading felt unclear", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] I enjoyed this class although the content overlapped quite a bit with what I've learned in other classes. I think this is a good choice for either students who are newer to the information or students who are super interested in urban studies who are going to be proactive about learning more and diving into the different case studies and policies we talk about. My favorite assignments were the simulation and the public meeting that we had to attend- It gave me a much better sense of what the topic actually looked like in the real world.", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] I really liked this course. The guest speakers were engaging and very experienced. They had a lot to offer and we could ask questions every time. The work was relatively light compared to other public policy classes so for someone interested in local government/urban development, I greatly recommend it.", "[0.8] [Spring 2022] Really interesting class! Great instructors - you'll learn a ton.", "[0.4] [Spring 2022] Be engaged with guest lecturers.", "[0.65] [Spring 2022] Fantastic speakers and good overview of urban studies problems and solutions for the environment and equity", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] I highly recommend taking this course if you are interested in sustainability and social justice. You get to meet a lot of government officials and hear their perspectives of working on land use issues. The class is mostly discussion based with a couple of writing assignments. You gain as much as you put into the class so do all readings if you can as they are very interesting.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] Loved this class! Teaching team was great, and I learned a ton about land use and city planning. I don't study or work in the space much, but found it very interesting and enlightening. Great readings, case studies, activities, guest speakers.", "[0.6] [Spring 2022] If you have any interests regarding land use, on the policy, development, or engineering side, this course will provide you with a completely new perspective which is very interesting.", "[0.8] [Spring 2022] i definitely recommend taking this course. it is very useful for any urban studies/public policy major.", "[0.0] [Spring 2021] -", "[0.7] [Spring 2021] This course provides great overview of the key issues facing cities, including climate change, housing shortages and equity. Provides a robust understanding of city planning and public participation.", "[0.8] [Spring 2021] Great class - needs to be more focused on internatoinal land use planning too", "[0.75] [Spring 2021] This is a great chance to learn the background behind city planning", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] Do it! The class really is taught with love and each step of the way the instructors are there to kindly show you how the world of zoning, local government, and general land use operates in the real world. If you're interested in knowing more than hypotheticals and what if's, take this class. It felt more like an internship because I learned so much that I feel is real-world applicable.", "[0.0] [Spring 2021] Take the course!", "[0.05] [Spring 2021] That the course is quite useful for grasping a lot of urban planning issues, but is a little limited to Bay Area/California issues because all of the practitioners are from this area.", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] This course is fantastic! The instructor are so knowledgeable, the assignments feel meaningful, and the content is broadly applicable. We also got to engage with many guest speakers, which was very enlightening. The work load is not heavy at all.", "[0.45] [Spring 2021] It is a must for anyone considering Urban Studies. Extremely interesting class.", "[0.8] [Spring 2021] I think this class was very fun and I very much enjoyed learning very real applicable content."], "URBANST 164": ["[1.0] [Spring 2022] This was one of the most irritating classes I have ever taken. If I had known that the assignments would consist of hours of meaningless, busy work, I would have dropped this class. The only reason I stuck with this class was because it applied to my major. We were so overloaded with meaningless assignments that we completely lost track of the original project. We had to spend our time doing an anonymous progress report on our teammates, but we had hardly started the project. \n\nPros\nI loved the class content. I enjoyed having dedicated time to consider the scale of sustainability and peruse TED Talks. It's a great compilation of resources. This class has great potential to be very helpful to students but not at this point.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] The community engagement part of the course can be very meaningful and you can learn a lot from it if you allow yourself to dive deep enough in your project. The readings are also an important complement to the course that will open up new perspectives on sustainability issues and solutions. Rick is a very present and dedicated instructor who cares about quality delivery and is very disciplined in getting students timely feedback.", "[0.0] [Spring 2022] Only take this class is Deland is teaching. Rick gives SO much busy work!!!", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] the client work was extremely rewarding, and the class material taught me a lot. one thing to note is that it felt like there was a lot of work (like writing out detailed meeting agendas and minutes, writing out progress reports on the project, etc.) that I felt took away valuable time that could have been spent either working on our client project or learning more class material. however, overall, I really enjoyed the class and learned a lot", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] Great course with the opportunity to work with community partners. There was a fair amount of administrative/busy work but the instructor was receptive to feedback around this. Guest speakers were great, and the instructor was very organized. Would take it again!", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] This is a really interesting class that will teach you a lot about topics of interest in urban sustainability and change what you think a city can be. There are lots of great, interesting guest speakers as well. It is quite a lot of work, particularly with the group project, so don't take this class unless you're prepared to work with classmates and a \"community partner.\"", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] you should take it if you are interested in urban aspects of sustainability. this course really emphasised not just the environmental part of sustainability but the human and economic component as well. the class requires good organization and a bit of busywork, but overall the community partner project was enjoyable and created a good learning experience", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] Rick is a very energetic teacher -- but his desire to be incredibly intentional in everything means that assignments can be very long and arduous, without always direct usefulness to the project. I hope in future years it is shaped to engage in the projects more actually than on unrelated project tasks.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] I'd say this class offers a great opportunity to learn in a way that differs from a traditional class room environment. From this class, I was able to gain tangible experience with working with an organization in a project team, and using class concepts and applying them to the real world. Professor Kos always creates an environment where you feel welcomed to contribute in class.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2020] Absolutely take this class! While most of the students in the class are Urban Studies / Earth Systems majors, I think the material is very accessible and very relevant for people outside of these fields of study. It teaches you to think more critically about your role as a Stanford students, as someone in the Bay Area, and as someone who may one day live in a city.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2020] Be aware: I thought this course would be about sustainability in terms of energy/environment and cities in terms of urban planning futuristic cities; instead, it was sustainability in terms of gentrification and cities in terms of understanding the history of specific communities. Knowing that, this class is very interesting from a community engagement standpoint. You work on real-world projects and understand the inner-workings of real-world politics. Deland is super nice and accomodating.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2020] I learned so much in this class! Deland is so knowledgeable, and the experience of working with a community partner throughout the entire quarter cannot be overstated. Class could sometimes be a little awkward in the Zoom setting, so the lectures weren't terribly interactive, but still very interesting and there were some great guests. The highlight by far was the ability to apply our newfound knowledge to making actionable change in the Bay Area. If you're even a little bit interested in sustainability and/or social justice, I definitely recommend this class.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2020] Take it!!! This is an amazing class and Deland is an incredible instructor. In this class you really are challenged to think about sustainability like you never have before. You'll walk away from this class being a better human LOL.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2020] Great for an intro to what sustainability is and how it is affecting the Bay Area", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] AMAZING CLASS. The guest speakers are engaging, and you'll likely find a field of study you're interesting in exploring from their testimonials. You'll also learn a lot from the community-engaged aspect, and you'll be pleased with how little \"classroom\" work there is, like papers or busy work.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2020] This was such an amazing opportunity. Working with a community partner is a great way to learn about and practice sustainability.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2020] such a cool way to learn and engage with the community", "[0.85] [Autumn 2020] An insightful course that enables you to gain real-world experience through community engagement and thoughtful reflection.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2020] Definitely take it!!! I took this class on a whim because I saw it in a mailing list, but the class is amazing. Deland is also such a joy and so knowledgable about Bay Area sustainability projects/policies. Definitely take this class if you have the chance. I worked with the City of Milpitas, and I've loved the experience of working in a group on an impactful project. The guest speakers are also wonderful and have so much to offer!", "[1.0] [Autumn 2020] Amazing class. I loved working with my community partner (City of Milpitas); as someone who grew up in the Bay Area, I enjoyed gaining a very new perspective of my home area and appreciated learning about many key social, economic and political issues here. I truly felt like I'd made an impact at the end of the class. Highly recommend this class!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2020] I highly recommend taking this class! I learned so much from both Deland's lectures and my community partner/mentor. This is a great opportunity for those interested in sustainability!", "[0.5] [Autumn 2020] Take it. Especially if you're someone who is going to work in a technical field like me. It exposes you to important new concepts and gives you some new ideas about how you might want to center your work in the future.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2020] I would definitely recommend this course. It is very interesting, educational about sustainability and you get hands-on work in the field.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] This was a great experience! It was nice to break up the typical reading and assignments from my other classes with the work we did with our community partners. It's an awesome way to have some real-world experience in some areas you're interested in learning more about or pursuing a career in.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2020] Deland is great at communicating if you need help, assistance, or guidance in the class. Don't be afraid to reach out to her. The class also provides time for discussion both over forms and in class.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2020] This is a very heavy workload class, but the community engagement portion is worth it in my opinion. Make sure you stay on top of the busy work assigned throughout the quarter as it can get very overwhelming", "[0.85] [Autumn 2020] This is a fantastic course if you are looking to make an impact in the Bay Area community with a focus of social sustainability. It is also a great way to broaden your understanding of what sustainability means.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2019] This class can be helpful if you want a general overview about many topics in urban studies and social equity. The projects focus a lot on social equity and learning about others' stories. Project deliverables might not be what you expect them to be in the beginning of the class but the process should be rewarding regardless.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] I would recommend taking this course for it provides a comprehensive view on sustainability that many aren't familiar with. Regarding group projects, make sure to always maintain good communication between group members and community partners.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2019] It will give you an added dimension of decision making that is amplifying underrepresented voices. You will learn to consider and listen to perspectives you hadn't in the past fur to larger systemic issues that marginalize such voices.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] The lectures are very interesting, and you will get the most out of them if you do the readings. I know that they are very long and dense, but they cover a wide range of interesting topics that can spark an interest in you. Also, make the most of your time working with the community partners on the project because time will fly by very quickly.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] The lectures are wonderful, and the readings are engaging. However if you take this class but don't have the time to work on the project a significant amount each week, your project might suffer and make it a stressful experience rather than an opportunity for growth.  Also, if you want to sign up for a technical project, make sure you have the requisite skills or develop a clear plan for how you will build those skills!", "[0.65] [Autumn 2019] Definitely would recommend!", "[0.45] [Autumn 2019] good class for community involvement, take it", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS! As a non-EarthSys/ non-UrbanStudies major I learned so much from Deland. This is one of my favorite courses that I have taken at Stanford. You get out of it as much as you put into it. The workload is manageable, but it is a very rewarding experience working with community partners and seeing how the work you do throughout the quarter has a real world effect.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2019] Good introduction to the equity issues facing cities and allows students to take a step back and see issues from a more systemic level and with more perspectives", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] This is definitely a course that will change the way you think and interact with the world around you. I wish I had taken more seriously the readings, because those do so much to inform how you engage with your community partners. Regardless, Deland does such an incredible job structuring conversation to include everyone in the room, as well as the perspectives we don't typically hear from (ie: marginalized communities of color or low-income). I think she does a good job of deconstructing the idea that at Stanford we're going to change the world, and breaks that down into bite size pieces-- how we can interact with our communities in a positive, meaningful way to impart an even small amount of change, and, of course, how to leverage that change for long-term success", "[-0.35] [Autumn 2019] The difficult part is working with the community partner and being fast with the deadlines and finding time to visit them off campus.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2019] It's a good class if you do the readings and pay attention in class, and you care a lot about the material; otherwise, you won't get much out of it. Choose your project carefully.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2019] Take this class for an in-depth look into city planning and sustainability! This class will teach you how to apply your skills outside the classroom.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2019] You get out of this class what you put in. This class could be very regarding if you have the time to put in to the class. However, it isn't a ton of work.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] Readings, lectures, and in class discussions are really interesting and I took away a lot from them. Working with the community partners was difficult to balance at times with schoolwork, so be sure to stay on top of your project deadlines and be consistent with how much work is put in each week. If your project isn't progressing at the pace you want, feel empowered to talk to Deland about taking it in another direction which you can get more out of and also create more impact for the community organizations you are working with. I wish I had more time to dedicate to this course and do all the readings. Also Deland is super impressive and interesting to talk to about the work she has done personally. Overall I recommend this course highly, but it takes a lot of self-motivation to stay on top of readings and project deadlines.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2019] N/A", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Deland is an inspiring instructor who is very knowledgeable and passionate about the material she presents, especially since she has participated in the some of the very projects she discusses. She brings a unique point of view to the class and never fails to foster our creativity and excitement for new topics in sustainable cities. The opportunity to work with a community partner was rewarding and helped me better understand the groups and individuals at the front lines of addressing these real issues in the Bay Area.", "[0.4] [Autumn 2018] Don't miss lecture!!!!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] This class really helped me expand my definition of sustainability and gain crucial skills through the community-based component. Assign roles of team management and empathize with your project to be most successful.", "[-0.55] [Autumn 2018] TAKE IT!

You learn a lot and get a lot of experience with community-based work!", "[-0.55] [Autumn 2018] Don't miss class. Deland has a policy to assign you a 5 page paper on the readings for the week, and she doesn't forget. Just don't miss class it's long but manageable and if you're sick just sit in the back because it's better than having to write a 5 page response paper whilst ill.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2018] Really examine the requirements and timelines for each community partner project and think critically about what you can provide to them and what you will get out of doing the project before signing up for one.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] The course gives a brief overview of many urban sustainability topics. Deland is an excellent instructor and lecturer!

This class has an intersectional definition of sustainability and does not follow mainstream environmentalism. Deland is a great lecturer and all projects are interesting!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] Definitely take it! Super important material, very well taught, and the community aspect makes it feel worthwhile.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] This course provides you an amazing opportunity to reexamine your values with regards to what matters to you about cities. Do you just care about economic development and modern buildings or also about affordable housing, about equitable allocation of green space, about gentrification and community change as well as food access?

Absolutely take it. It is a fractal, with so much to explore: as such, the more time you put into it, the more you will get out of it and the more you will learn.

The experiences you build in this class will stay with you and will inform all of your future work, no matter your home discipline or department.", "[0.4] [Autumn 2017] You should appreciate your meetings with your community partners and the knowledge that they have. Instead of insisting on your own understanding, listen to them as they have expertise in the local situation.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2017] The long (and required) lectures do not relate directly to the team projects, but they provide insight into many economic issues around the Bay Area and the United States in general. The hands-on projects represent an easy means of getting involved in community work through a class, and the practice in teamwork and public speaking would benefit almost any student. Make sure to carefully choose from the available projects at the beginning of the course.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2017] I highly recommend this course! It is a really nice way to apply one's skills and knowledge of urban issues to a real life context.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] Good course. There's not too much work outside of working with your community partner, and this work with your partner is engaging and interesting. Weekly reflections are often a pain,  so make sure not to leave them until Friday! I would recommend this class.

Make sure all members of the team are doing their part.", "[0.95] [Winter 2017] If you want a captivating introduction to the sustainability focus of urban studies, I would highly recommend this class! The group projects are really interesting and getting the chance to work with an actual community partner from the Bay Area is an amazing opportunity in itself!", "[0.7] [Winter 2017] Make sure you can see yourself being happy with the project you get assigned, as this is what your entire workload will revolve around.", "[0.7] [Winter 2017] It's a really great class if you want to see how real world nonprofits or government agencies work. The biggest part of the class is the final group project done in collaboration with a local nonprofit/government. There's a few projects you can select from, and they all have some kind of field work.", "[0.7] [Winter 2017] Good class for introduction to all parts of urban sustainability. If you are more interested in a particular area of urban studies, this class might be too broad for you.", "[0.7] [Winter 2017] Do more of the readings to better understand and internalize the many new concepts we learn!

You learn a lot about the contexts of housing and city sustainability, and you'll leave the class with at least a base understanding of the concept of a \"sustainable city\"", "[0.8] [Winter 2017] For students interested in the course, as with all courses how much you get out of this course is dependent on the commitment you invest into it. There really are no shortcuts. Also, if you have something you'd particularly like to do, make sure to read the project descriptions thoroughly before ranking your choices.", "[0.85] [Winter 2017] I think the projects are great. However, it takes a lot of time and self-initiative to produce a successful deliverable.", "[0.7] [Winter 2017] Readings can be long and are you get more from the class than the reading eg dont do the reading. otherwise the class is interesting and beneficial for development of basic work skills"], "URBANST 165": ["[0.8] [Spring 2022] great class! the instructor knows what he's talking about and is very engaging!", "[0.7] [Spring 2022] You should take this course if you are passionate about transportation!

Not too much work with this professor. The only thing I'd warn about is the lectures - he tends to talk and talk and it can be boring, especially  if there's no discussion. Wish we had had more time for discussion, especially since the class was a mix of so many cool people: undergrads, Law students, master's students, all from varying fields but with a career interest in planning. Workload is fine.", "[0.65] [Spring 2022] Very chill, but the lectures are very filled with useful information.", "[-0.65] [Autumn 2017] If you're not strongly interested in sustainability and transportation, this class might not fit to you.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2017] Professor Kott is a very cool guy, knows a lot about transportation, and is  also a rather nice grader. Professor Rivasplata is a little more scattered, I definitely feel like I learned more from our class meetings with Professor Kott. Either way, you have to really read the course readings (aside from the redundant textbook chapters) thoroughly to get a lot out of this course. It's an easy class to just ride through without putting much work into it, but just know that you won't get much out of it that way.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2017] This is a solid class: the topic is interesting, and the assignments are unique and relevant (e.g. a walking study of Palo Alto). It's highly accessible to people without much prior knowledge of the subject, but also offers opportunities to go deeper for students who are already knowledgeable.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] Great course with interesting topics. The group project and individual essay are both very rewarding. Expect a lot of work during the final few weeks.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2017] While I originally found the material to be decently obvious, I was shocked at the end of the course to realize just how much I'd learned. Assignments were helpful and the teaching was excellent. Dr. Kott & Rivasplata are very generous in kind in helping students understand the material. Overall, would recommend!", "[0.6] [Autumn 2017] Great course, but be prepared for a lot of work at the end.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2017] If you're interested in transportation planning, it's a great class. Dr. Kott and Dr. Rivasplata are experts in the field and impart a lot of valuable information. Lectures are sometimes a bit dry and I wish more conversation was facilitated. Also, definitely note that the class was extremely backloaded. There's almost no work the first 5 weeks but then multiple large projects and quizzes at the end. In the future I'd recommend that these are spaced out a bit better.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2017] kott and rivasplata are cool. good overview of the essentials", "[0.55] [Autumn 2017] Definitely take it if you are at all interested in transportation. Don't be afraid to ask lots of questions in class to prompt the professors to delve deeper into a topic you're interested in. This course is very surface level a lot of the time, but Professors Kott and Rivasplata have immense experience in the transportation sector and are willing to tell you more, even if they were only planning on teaching the most basic aspects.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] While this is probably too deep a dive for most freshmen, this class is an incredibly rewarding higher division elective for all those with an interest in transportation, urban design, and local government. A lot of classes at Stanford get caught in the \"introductory trap\" of skimming the big picture concepts while shirking the details. This class is the opposite. Expect to learn about everything from the bus vs. rail transportation planning debate to the finer points of parking pricing. No engineering or math background is required or particularly useful. Both of the instructors are real experts with real world experience in their subjects and incredible connections with the local transportation community. While this class does involve a fair bit of work (it makes you work for those 5 units), it amply rewards whatever time its students put into it.", "[0.5] [Autumn 2017] The professors are very well-intentioned, knowledgeable and kind, but not the most engaging or interactive with the class. The class really is what you put into it - you can go the extra mile to learn more if you're interested, but the class itself does not require you to go in much depth", "[0.85] [Autumn 2017] I would not recommend this course for most people - the instructors are very kind and thoughtful, but tended to repeat each other in their separate lectures. There could be a lot more done with this course- for example, the final individual policy papers could be worked up to, and there could be more integration with data science to support some of the statements we made generally about transportation. Additionally, while the professors mention equity, it could be more strongly woven throughout the whole class."], "URBANST 166": [], "URBANST 168": ["[0.85] [Spring 2022] Taking this course with Dr. Montgomery was truly an amazing experience.

This course is so amazing in terms of it having meaningful and intentional conversations about topics that are very pertinent to society and the community around you.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] This is such a great class!! I came into the class without a solid background on environmental justice issues, but Dr. Montgomery really encourages students to incorporate their interests into the course and individual research topics.

There are a lot of readings, but they are well worth it, and Carol puts a lot of thought into the curriculum. I wish we had more time to discuss the readings in class (which was only 2hrs/week this quarter)", "[1.0] [Autumn 2021] I highly recommend this class. There are a lot of readings, but the professor is very understanding and knows that we most likely won't be reading them all, so it is okay to skim! The readings are also very interesting for the most part, but you get a lot of information from lecture as well so it is important to attend class. You should engage in discussion because it is helpful with understanding the readings and all of the historical information we learn about. Overall, a pretty smooth class with not too tedious tasks and very engaging!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] very enjoyable course for advocates interested in social justice, equity, being more informed to address systems of inequity", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Lots of reading but Carol is a wonderful and engaging instructor. She said herself to skim the reading, but invest time in ones that are interesting to you.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2021] The course material is interesting and engaging and really relevant to anyone who has connections to California. Even though class only meets for a couple of hours a week, the course is organized so that you are spending lots of time outside of class reading (especially if you do the 3 book review assignments)", "[0.7] [Autumn 2021] The readings for this course are super insightful! The book reviews are not too much work and allows you to personalize what you get out of this class. Recommend if you haven't had a chance to do history at Stanford yet.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Professor McKibben is incredibly passionate about the subject she teaches, which was very exciting to me. However, I felt the course was fairly disorganized. Each class period entailed a lecture, a guest speaker, and student presentations. Readings were incredibly long and I unfortunately was unable to complete a single one. 250-word responses to the reading were due before each lecture, which were fairly easy to throw together quickly. The responses were a participation grade and then there were three graded essays throughout the quarter. For me, the lectures were difficult to follow, and Professor McKibben was attempting to fit too many items into the short, once-a-week two hour meeting. I would have preferred meeting twice a week and having longer discussions about the reading, since it was mostly a listening-based course. Perhaps this is because the course itself is incredibly ambitious - it is basically attempting to teach most of California history through a lens of raciality. All this being said, I think part of the reason I didn't get as much out of the course was my own fault - I could have made a better effort to do the readings, and the first quarter back from the pandemic was really intense for me for a lot of reasons, making it hard for me to focus on school work. Professor McKibben is very knowledgeable and will meet with you one-on-one as much as you would like. She is also a very easy grader, if that is appealing to you.", "[0.25] [Autumn 2021] This class is really what you put into it - if you do the readings and come prepared to class you will learn a lot, it you don't you won't learn much. The professor is very knowledgable on the history of race in California and you can learn a lot from her.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] This class covers a lot of history in a really short amount of time. Even though we don't get to learn everything, we do cover a good amount, from colonial times to the present day. We focus on primarily LA and the Bay Area, though there is some content about the Valley and areas like Stockton.  There's good coverage on the experience of Black, East Asian, South Asian, Latine, and Pacific Islanders, but not enough on Native peoples from California. I think that's an essential part of California, especially urban California's, history that is missing from the course.  Carol is a great professor though and really knows her stuff -- she also has a lot of connections to academics and writers and brings lots of the writers of the course's content to come in and discuss with us, which is cool.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] I loved this course! The service learning component was incredible!!! Professor McKibben is really passionate about the subject matter and she really wants all of her students to succeed. Loved this class and would recommend to anybody in any major.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2021] Readings are key in this course because they provide a lot of context for in-class discussion and lecture. There wasn't a single reading I did not find interesting, although some definitely took more time and effort to understand compared to others. Highly recommend this course for anyone interested in the racial demographics of California.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] The readings for this course were incredible, and I would highly recommend this course if you have time to do the readings, or are interested in them. If you do not have time or interest in the readings, you will not get a solid overview of the history of race and ethnicity in urban California. Also, Professor McKibben is incredibly supportive and approachable!", "[0.55] [Autumn 2021] This course deconstructs California racial history from a multi dimensional perspective, encouraging students to take action with the knowledge they've obtained from the course", "[0.75] [Autumn 2021] The course is incredibly interesting and covers California history in a lot of depth. Content is a bit of history and a bit of sociology, with readings coming from a lot of notable events in history. It can feel a bit scattered at times but always found the lectures and readings fascinating.", "[0.3] [Autumn 2021] I found this course hard to follow at many points and it few notable takeaways. I think that is because it is tries to cover such a large span of time that it greatly sacrifices meaningful depth in every area that is touched upon.", "[0.85] [Spring 2021] This class is a good intro to race in urban California. It covers a lot of time and a lot of topics. Prof. McKibben is very accommodating, and wants to help students succeed in anyway she can.", "[0.2] [Spring 2021] The readings seem like a lot but if you break it up throughout the week its manageable", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] I highly recommend this course if you are an Urban Studies student. Carol's in depth knowledge of California history is very useful in better understanding how race relations have changed over time and how they've been reinforced through institutional changes. The readings for this course touch on various eras, locations in California, races, and topics that range from colonization & economic relations to suburbanization & social relations. If you're planning to do some type of research paper or project on urban California, this is the perfect course and I know Carol would provide useful feedback and guidance that could be incorporated into class assignments.", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] I loved this course! Professor McKibben is great and really prioritizes student wellbeing while making sure we all learned the course content.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] This is a class that you should take if you want to have a better understanding of the area around Stanford and what is behind place-specific dynamics of race, ethnicity, class, and gender across different local geographies. There is a lot of reading, but skimming is encouraged. Class sessions were long but they were also broken up well to allow for breaks. The guest speakers were amazing, each providing further background on their texts. Their visits allowed us the opportunity to ask additional questions and see how the researchers might connect their work to other texts we read or to other racial or ethnic groups or periods of California history.", "[0.85] [Spring 2021] This is a great course if you know next to nothing about CA history and the way it has influenced race relations into the present day. I've never taken a course like this before and I learned so much from it. I highly recommend it keeping in mind that there is a lot of reading and you really want to do as much of it as possible to get the most out of the course.", "[0.25] [Spring 2021] There is a lot of California history that is having impacts on today's society, racial relations, and racist/classist oppressions. This is a good course to see how todays issues are not new, but are just the newest iteration of old oppressions.", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] I would highly recommend this class to anyone consider it! You may have interactions with a lot of upperclassmen/ grad students, but you will only be better off because of it. This class is only worthwhile if you're willing to put time into the readings/understanding a broader California history. Otherwise, lectures will go over your head and you won't be motivated enough. If you're willing to put the time in, though, this class is amazing.", "[0.85] [Spring 2021] Professor McKibben is incredibly knowledgeable. You can tell her passion for these topics runs deep; it shows whenever she lectures or discusses the topics in-class. Not only is she invested in students gaining a deep understanding of the materials--she also wants her students to improve on her writing. As such, she gives multiple opportunities--from the weekly reflections, to the book reviews--to do that. Be prepared to do quite a bit of reading, but also to learn a lot! No need to have prior instruction on California's history. It was a joy to be under her instruction.", "[0.4] [Spring 2020] The course is interesting, the reading is dense (~ 50 pages a week), you learn more about history than modern race relations", "[0.8] [Spring 2020] I think this course amazing. I strongly recommend it. The information you will receive is very necessary. I dont believe you need to be an Urban Studies Major to take this class. Everyone needs to be educate on the topics that were taught in this course", "[1.0] [Spring 2020] If you want a better understanding of how race and ethnicity operate in relationship to urban space this class is a must. Although, we did not do the service learning component due to COVID, there is also great opportunity to engage with local communities through service learning. Its a positive, supportive and supportive space which can be nice if you have had a particularly ruff quarter relating to other professors. The instructor is well versed in the subject, kind hearted, and loves her students.", "[0.25] [Spring 2020] This is a very interesting class overall, but to really consume all the information and stay intrigued, you must participate. You can learn a tremendous amount from asking questions, especially questions that are hardly asked.", "[0.85] [Spring 2020] This class was very insightful for anyone looking to deepen their understanding the urban landscape across California. The instructor, Carol, is very kind and insightful and very willing to help you learn more about the areas that interest you the most based on your preferences. The readings are all well-selected, if a little lengthy.", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] This course made me regret not being a CSRE major from day one. The subject matter is fascinating, weighty, and complex, yet Professor McKibben makes it easily approachable. Her hands-on teaching style is one of the highlights of the course. Her lecture style is enthusiastic and funny, discussions are engaging and deep, and she gives more one-on-one attention to each student than any other class I've been in. The end result is a class that felt like it was custamized to my interests while still ensuriung I go outside my comfort zone. Three hour class sessions are intimidating over zoom, but Professor McKibben structured each course with lectures, guest speakers, discussions, and occasional breaks in such a way that I rarely suffered friom \"zoom fatigue.\" She was also flexible with assignments, due dates, and readings starting week 6, far before other professors starting making academic accomodations available. Ultimately, this class inspired me to take more CSRE courses in the future, and to join an informal summer \"book club\" guided by Professor McKibben with other students in the class. I would highly recommend this class to anyone, including and especially non-CSRE majors.", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] Absolutely take it!!! Carol is one of my favorite professors ever, and you'll learn a ton in the class. Even with a 3-hour time slot, she managed to make the class very engaging and interesting, and we take breaks every hour. I am also proud to be a member of the Carol Fan Club! Take this class -- you'll learn a huge amount and make great connections.", "[0.85] [Spring 2020] Great course, great instructor.", "[1.0] [Spring 2019] Professor McKibben is super passionate about her work. She is really considerate of assigning super worth while readings that you will want to purchase to enjoy after the class is over. She is super helpful and insisting on continuously looking over your writing drafts. She really tries to push the conversation forward during discussion and brings in so much outside information that is super insightful and complex. Really worthwhile class with readings I am glad she recommended.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] The reading load is hefty but worthwhile if you dedicate yourself to it.  Carol is kind and accommodating and truly wants to help you succeed.", "[0.4] [Spring 2019] Take this class for the history and stay committed to the readings because you'll learn the most from there -- McKibben has a great selection. Be present in discussions, but don't expect to extract significant insight from those alone.", "[0.35] [Spring 2019] Recommend to anyone even if you don't know anything XD.", "[0.65] [Winter 2018] Take it! Professor McKibben is knows so much and will be a great resource as you conduct your research.", "[0.5] [Winter 2018] McKibben might first come off as a micro-manager, so if you're really averse to that style, you might be better off in another course. But if you can learn to live with it, this course could teach you a lot of important history regarding minority populations, with applications beyond California.", "[-0.95] [Winter 2018] This class was stressful, disorganized and painful to get through. The professor is unprofessional, rude and disrespectful, and creates a class environment that is uncomfortable and unproductive. She would say disparaging things about the community college students we were supposed to be partnered with, and eventually blamed THEM for the partnership falling through, even though it was largely due to her own fault and disorganization.  I can't even say that I learned much about California's history or about majority-minority cities - there were sprinkles of knowledge and interesting discoveries here and there, but I would not consider it worth the drama caused by taking the class and interacting with the professor weekly.  Additionally, the readings are a lot, are not always interesting or relevant, and the professor expects you to be working on a paper and doing extensive research at the same time all quarter. Her micromanaging of everyone's projects made it impossible to actually choose what direction you wanted to study, despite her claims that \"we\" were choosing a topic for ourselves.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2016] It is an enjoyable class and you learn a lot from it.  It gives a different perspective.  McKibben is also a very knowledgable and kind teacher.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2016] Make sure to do all of the reading! Not only do you need it for class discussions, the assignments/readings are very interesting", "[0.95] [Autumn 2016] -Go to Professor McKibben's Office Hours! She's incredibly approachable and very interested in helping her students engage with their research topics and with class material.  -Dedicate yourself fully to the final paper: the final paper gives you the opportunity to study a topic in depth and you will receive a lot of guidance from Professor McKibben; as such, you should pick a topic that you really care about", "[0.35] [Autumn 2016] It's a cool class! A little long and the lectures are as well, but prof is funny-ish.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2016] Professor McKibben if one of the best Professor's I've had at Stanford. She truly cares about her students. She loves to give constant feedback and she structures the class so that you never have to be stressed about the big assignments. Take it or regret it!", "[0.8] [Autumn 2016] I would definitely recommend that a student take this course - it is an extremely valuable course for students attending college in the Palo Alto area, and it provides necessary background knowledge to California's urban history."], "URBANST 169B": ["[0.95] [Winter 2022] Carol is amazing and super helpful! I loved this course because it helped me really dive deep into a topic I was interested in. You can make it as time intensive as you want and there is a lot flexibility in what you can do. From this class, my work may be published and Carol has really supported me throughout this whole process. Could not recommend more highly!", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Carol is great and is super knowleadgable! If you want to write a paper that has to do with race and ethnicity in California, at any point in history, she's a great resource.  She genuinely cares about everyone's paper and does her best to connect you with readings and resources that will help you.", "[1.0] [Winter 2022] Professor McKibben is a very kind and well-intended instructor who does students a great service in creating space to explore important issues of race and find their voice on these topics through this course. She aims to create a very supportive and constructive environment, which is appreciated. her enthusiasm for this work is clear and enjoyable to be around. Her knowledge of her particular area of study and of resources that students can look into is extensive and often useful. That said, I think there are major opportunities for Professor McKibben to improve in how she conducts the course.\n\nSpeakers: This is a course dealing with race in California, yet half of the speakers invited and a good portion of the works recommended for reading come from White perspectives. These voices are valid and useful, but I think the professor should make an effort to bring in more academics of color to speak to their work and opinions on various topics. They would offer a more nuanced perspective to equity work, systemic injustices, and how intent and impact are often misaligned in the history of race in California, which I thought was weakly presented in this course. I also noticed several times throughout the quarter that professor McKibben spoke for or over the speakers of color, often undermining their voice or perspective, which I found very disrespectful. Even a well-intended woman committed to racial-justice can have biases and I think professor McKibben would benefit from doing reflection on where her own may appear in this course. I know she is committed to this work so I hope she finds this a valuable suggestion.\n\nClass Structure: We spent nearly an hour most class sections doing round-robin updates on our progress. While check-ins are valuable, most students didn't have the context for each others' papers to be able to weigh in on these check-ins outside of their own. This made this time feel wasted because we just sat there while each student gave an update. It could have more effectively been managed if Professor McKibben made one hour of the class an open-office hour that each student was required to attend a 10-minute slot for but could spend the other time working on their project (it felt rude to be working while others were giving their update so I ended up just sitting there for an hour each week). We could have also been required to raise one issue that we were struggling with in the research process that was widely applicable to the class for an open discussion and to source other student perspectives on what they were trying with their work. Having a consistent student partner that you did check-ins each week would have been more helpful for consistent feedback as well, but the current full class structure often felt like wasted space.\n\n[Feedback continued in next section]", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Carol is very receptive to her students' ideas and has a lot of experience and knowledge under her belt. She has so much enthusiasm and care for each of our topics, and always asks us to turn in as many rough drafts as possible, that's how much attention she pays to us and how much she want her students to succeed. It's difficult but if you are looking for a way to learn to write a thorough research paper, something I don't have much exposure to, this class is supportive and excellent to guide you through it."], "URBANST 171": ["[0.9] [Spring 2022] Danno is an excellent lecturer and the class is engaging and fun. I came into it with no prior design experience at Stanford, and found it accessible and fun", "[0.45] [Spring 2022] This course is beginner-friendly. Dan does his best to provide resources for the first-time urban designers. I took this course exclusively CE and was fine. Not really 5 units of work for the first half of the quarter, but became a bit closer to that towards the end right before final presenatations", "[0.3] [Spring 2022] Take it if you liked intro to urban design - it's not intense at all and you can continue building a portfolio if you take the class seriously. You can learn a lot from Dehan, especially if you ask for advice and challenge his critiques.", "[0.75] [Spring 2022] Really interesting design issues that change from year-to-year, but really makes you think about the lived environment and why you enjoy the spaces that you are in.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] This studio class gives a lot of freedom to execute creativeness!

Danno is always super helpful, kind, and patient as we all discover our own design process. Especially via Zoom, I felt like the class was a small community. Urban design is also extremely enjoyable and makes you better appreciate the spaces that make you happy.", "[0.85] [Spring 2018] The class is a lot of fun and you get to do really cool things with urban spaces. There are also a lot of skills I did not think I'd pick up like, like presentation speaking.

It's a great introduction to these topics. Professor Kos does a great job at making the assignments really fun and not too time consuming. Readings and videos are assigned to supplement lectures and are incredibly insightful. Guest speakers were also brought in to discuss relevant topics like advocacy and participatory planning, and even real estate and how the market affects development. By far one of the best classes I've taken... a good mix of learning and helpful assignments that aren't simply boring papers or useless tests. Only complaint I had really were that there was only one session per week, and that assignment requirements can feel a bit tedious sometimes, however (5 pictures with two sentence description, for example) but it's a small thing.", "[0.85] [Summer 2021] Do it! Prof. Kos is awesome and also has great taste in guest speakers.", "[0.85] [Summer 2021] If you are interested in learning about Urban Planning with a focus on policy, this is the course to take. I have taken many courses in Urban Studies, and this is by no means redundant or repetitive. There is quite a lot of work involved given that it is a 3-unit class (it could  potentially be 4 units), but the work os extremely enjoyable and helpful to anyone who wants to know how our cities work.", "[0.85] [Spring 2019] This is a great course of those interested in city planning, my favorite part of the course would be the guest lecturers who come into class and speak about their jobs and planning issues they deal with in the bay area.", "[0.8] [Spring 2019] The professor is great, most of the content is probably learned in the readings more than the lectures themselves. Very valuable class", "[0.9] [Spring 2019] Prof. Raya is a great explainer, and also happens to be well connected. She takes care to cover planning issues from multiple perspectives and brings in excellent guest speakers.", "[0.85] [Spring 2019] It almost feels like a super summary of the URBANST core curriculum. Similar texts and theories. There are times when guest lectures become more radical and veer off traditional URBANST classes (which is what i appreciated the most!).", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] It's a pretty good class! You won't learn the day to day of an urban planner, but you'll definitely learn how urban theory applies to urban planning. I enjoyed the class, Professor Raya has a lot to teach and is very passionate about her work. Expect a large amount of reading, but it's okay to skim!", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] Really great opportunity to learn about the urban planning process from someone with a lot of experience in the field. Guest lectures provide additional insights and round-out instruction. There's a great opportunity to explore any of your interests in the urban planning area via the final assignment.", "[0.2] [Spring 2019] This course was less an in-depth introduction to urban planning and more of a broad overview of the kinds of urban studies concepts you'd learn in other courses, with a bit of planning tacked on here and there. Overall an interesting course, but don't expect you're really going to learn an extraordinary amount about planning itself.", "[0.75] [Spring 2019] Amazing class if you want to learn how cities work and what planners are thinking so that everyone can live well in their city!", "[0.85] [Spring 2019] I expected this class to provide me with an overview of what I might expect on a day to day basis as a planner as well as some more technical skills that I could use in a city's planning department. I didn't experience either of these things in the class. Honestly it felt like an intro urban studies class rather than an elective. It definitely reaffirmed my decision to not pursue a coterm here at Stanford.", "[0.4] [Winter 2017] Take the class if you're at all interested in learning more about urban planning from both a theory perspective and practical applications. The three hours pass by a lot faster than you'd think.", "[0.95] [Winter 2017] Heavy reading, but very interesting and class conversation is awesome because people can bring in personal experience and observations in relation to the topics at hand. The class can be whatever you want it to be if you let Professor Raya know what specific aspects of planning you are most interested in! The 3 hour long class can be tough though, so bring coffee or a snack or whatever you need -- its worth it.", "[0.6] [Winter 2017] Great introduction to many aspects of urban planning", "[0.0] [Winter 2017] Take it for a broad introduction to urban planning!", "[0.85] [Winter 2017] Great class! Marisa is a real one. Solid intro to planning, and a couple cool speakers. The weekly assignments are easy to do. The final paper is a solid exercise in thinking through a planning topic/problem. 3 hours of class can be a struggle though.", "[0.75] [Winter 2017] Great class! Assignments might be confusing but Prof. Raya is very responsive to email.", "[0.35] [Winter 2017] Divide the work throughout the week because there are an incredible amount of readings.  They can easily sneak up on you.", "[0.3] [Winter 2017] Be sure to do as much of the reading as possible and don't afraid to bring your own background/interests/concerns into class", "[0.75] [Winter 2017] This is a great intro to the principles of urban planning - worth taking even if you don't want to be an urban planning, as it provides important context into decisions made that influence all of our lives", "[0.6] [Winter 2017] Great introductory class into the subject of urban planning. However, it is not a technical class", "[0.85] [Winter 2017] This is a fantastic class! The readings are really interesting and diverse. Totally approachable to anyone, regardless of your experience with or knowledge about urban planning. If you know little, like I did, it will totally change your perspective on cities and the ways in which we live in them.", "[0.45] [Winter 2017] its easy", "[0.9] [Winter 2017] I wholeheartedly recommend this course to anyone interested in thinking about what it means to bring a diversity of people and communities together in one setting. The course covered an impressive breadth of material for the depth that attended it - everything from city planning (its sometimes troubling history, evolving present, and imaginative future) and community collaboration, to economic development and urban activism. All of this material was presented engagingly and coherently by Professor Raya, with well-chosen community speakers and refreshingly relevant reading. Fantastic course."], "URBANST 173": ["[0.6] [Autumn 2021] Great course really learn about almost the real estate side of economy and what makes different cities grow and so fourth.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2021] Fascinating concepts, and well-selected readings!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] Definitely should take this class as it is very informative and gives you a insight into the spaces around you in a way that you have never thought of before. It encourages thinking very in depth about cities which I really enjoyed.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] I really liked this class. Mark is a great lecturer and you get to decide how much time you want to put into the class. The midterm was very doable and I feel like I learn a lot after every lecture. Not a big time commitment if you are stretched thin already.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] One of the best courses I've taken at Stanford, as the material is incredibly interesting and well taught Mark is a funny and engaging lecture who asks for class participation often. I wish it was more than two major grades, however,", "[0.55] [Autumn 2021] Definitely take this class! I learned so much about cities, origins, and downfalls. If your lack of economic knowledge is deterring from taking this class, do not let it, Wolfe goes over the basic set of economic principles that you need to know in the beginning of the course, and he is willing to help you with anything!", "[0.65] [Autumn 2021] This course was really interesting. The midterm and final were very difficult, though, and there wasn\u2019t much time for the final. Make sure to pace yourself on in person exams. Apart from that, the concepts were very interesting.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] The lectures are very interesting. Great class for non-majors interested in practical applications of urban studies, polisci, and economics on decision-making in cities.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Take this class! The lectures cover such interesting content that are very relevant to our everyday life. I came to this class with 0 background in econ and I still managed to understand everything & learn a lot! Wolfe makes the class very engaging and he is just a great person to talk to! Don't be scared to talk to him after class or during office hour. He cares a lot about his students and will do everything to make sure you succeed.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] This course is super interesting, especially if you are interested in either urban studies, econ, or both!", "[0.6] [Autumn 2021] take it, mark wolfe is a great lecturer", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Dr. Wolfe is a very engaging professor and the lectures are super interesting. If you are curious about cities I would highly recommend this class.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Fascinating course learning everything about cities. If you have any interest in cities and urban economics, take this course. Professor Wolfe is an excellent teacher who knows the material extremely well. It's not too much work \u2014 you kind of get what you put into it, depending on how much you put into the readings and the day-to-day classwork. Either way, this class taught me a lot more about cities and the economics behind their formation and growth. Very enjoyable class overall.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] This class is a great bridge between Econ 1 and Intro to Urban Studies/Intro to Urban Planning. The professor touches on a variety of topics and explains the process behind them, so it is very useful for anyone interested in urban planning, policy, local government. There are no assignments except for a midterm exam and a final exam/paper, but readings can be quite dense. That being said, the readings are incredibly insightful and the professor himself is also very willing to answer any questions. He's really knowledgeable and his expertise in law makes him a great resource to have for anyone interested in planning/law/local government. Overall one of the most relevant classes at Stanford, and pretty low-stress compared to other Urban studies or public policy courses offered.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] I highly recommend this course it is very interesting and the professor is engaging.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] Professor Wolfe is the best instructor I've had at Stanford. Extreme depth of knowledge about urban policy and brought a balanced perspective to sensitive issues like housing and gentrification. Definitely take it!!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Amazing content. Mark is a great lecturer who deeply cares about the topics he discusses, but you get what you put into this class. A little disorganized with tests because there is so much disconnected content, but overall- I LOVED THIS CLASS", "[0.45] [Autumn 2021] good", "[0.0] [Autumn 2021] Take it and do the readings. They pile up and you won't be able to catch up unless you do them the week they are given.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2021] worth it if you are interested in the material. Not a difficult class - very reasonable workload", "[0.45] [Spring 2020] Do the readings they're so informative and really interesting", "[0.6] [Spring 2020] Mark is a very approachable person and is great at breaking down economic terms.", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] This course covers a ton of awesome topics and brings in many real world examples from across the nation and the world. There are a lot of course readings, but they are really interesting and I think you can still fully engage in the course discussions and take a lot away from the class even if you only really read 50% of the readings and skim the rest because they tend to apply the same idea in various contexts", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] Great class! Mark is super fun and engaging and helpful!", "[0.85] [Spring 2020] For those interested in urban spaces and patterns within urban spaces, I would highly recommend. I was able to analyze city from a new lens, and feel like many of the structures and policies we see in cities were contextualized well.", "[0.75] [Winter 2018] Take it if you are interested in real estate, urban studies, economics, public policy, urban planning, etc. It is a very rewarding course if you want to get exposure to urban economics. It will prepare you for other classes.", "[0.95] [Winter 2018] This is a fantastic course if you want a broad overview of economic factors affecting cities. However, this class felt introductory in nature, so it is probably best for freshmen and sophomores. The best readings were those that were recently published and relevant to our class discussions. The textbooks were less useful to our discussions (we minimally covered them in our class). All in all, I would only recommend this class if you haven't taken other urban studies courses along with ECON 1. If you have, the material can feel redundant, and at times, obvious to those that have lived in any built up urban area.", "[0.85] [Winter 2018] You need to take this course. Bottom line, no exceptions.  The teaching is INCREDIBLE, so engaging, I was so excited to go to class every day.

Now more than ever people need to take this course regardless of what field you hope to go into. Definitely take the CEL option. It's not that much more work, I promise.", "[1.0] [Spring 2020] Pretty good course with some really useful, practical takeaways. It can be a lot of work (and reading) but really useful info. Guest speakers were fantastic. Larry is really sweet and cares a lot about his students.", "[0.85] [Spring 2020] Good start to thinking about advocating for other communities. I have no clue how this class works out side of zoom, but definitely take it if you are interested!", "[0.65] [Spring 2020] I highly recommend this course for anyone interested in organizing or advocacy because you can carry the material you learn from this course into your life and possibly your career.", "[0.5] [Spring 2020] The reading and guest speakers are great. The lectures drag on a bit and are mainly rehashing the readings", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] Take it, especially if you're interested in a career or future hobby of activism and social good. From political campaigning strategies to lobbying to nonprofit-focused stuff, this is such a comprehensive course. I found it pretty low-stress and extremely interesting.", "[0.45] [Spring 2020] This is a good course to learn about communications, organization, and tactics of social advocacy organizations.", "[0.0] [Spring 2020] I have to say that I wouldn't suggest this course. It isn't well-organized.", "[0.6] [Spring 2019] A great class in  which you learn  a lot", "[0.35] [Spring 2019] I thought the organization, reading materials and cases were excellent.  Lectures were dry but were only about 20 minutes of the class.  The classes were primarily interactive based on cases and exercises", "[0.2] [Spring 2019] This is an interesting class but Professor Litvak does occasionally talk a lot or over explain activities", "[0.35] [Spring 2019] Honestly, not worth it. Just read a book on networking.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] this is an excellent class. most of the readings are fascinating case studies or robust and helpful models. you will do an in-class activity almost every day so it's very hands-on and often forces you to think critically and quickly just like with real-world organizing. a lot of what we did in this class is directly applicable to real coalition-building and activism practices.", "[0.4] [Spring 2018] Definitely take it even if you don't do the CEL portion if you are interested in public service or advocacy type work. You learn things that may at first seem simple but are actually very complicated and complex.", "[0.4] [Spring 2018] Highly recommend, gives you tools to make change", "[0.25] [Spring 2018] be prepared to be talked at. class will not end on time. you will get out as much as you put in.", "[0.25] [Spring 2018] Be prepared for a good amount of reading. This is only a problem as some of the material feels redundant.", "[0.85] [Spring 2018] really practical skills based - really important skills for advocacy work, activism, and policy work - super informative and helpful class", "[0.7] [Spring 2018] This class will give you a lot of extremely applicable tools.  Litvak is super knowledgeable and a funny teacher.  There is a fair bit of reading and sometimes material can get a little dull, but it is worth it", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] Take it! It's a GREAT course with an amazing instructor that really cares about teaching his students! No busy work, and Larry tries really hard to make sure all of his students are engaged and learning. Would take again", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] Take this class if you have any interest in political advocacy! Professor Litvak does a great job, and hearing the perspectives of the other students was super enlightening.", "[0.45] [Spring 2018] I took this course the first time it was offered. Although it had its growing pains, it was a very interesting exploration of theories of advocacy.", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] This course was one of my favorites at Stanford! If possible, I would highly recommend enrolling in the CEL section of the course. In addition to being well organized and a great forum to discuss advocacy with Professor Litvak in a smaller course environment, being able to work directly with an organization was a unique opportunity to utilize and build on the principles of effective advocacy learned in lecture in an applied setting."], "URBANST 180A": [], "URBANST 180B": [], "URBANST 181": ["[0.9] [Spring 2021] This was one of the very best courses I have enrolled in at stanford\u2013 it is the perfect option for any student, and particularly someone interested in earth systems, sustainability, biology or engineering.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] This is a great class! There's so much to learn about the plants that nourish us. Patrick is a great professor whose interest in sharing plant knowledge is made clear through his teaching. This class is a great way to learn more about urban agriculture's impact and about the O'Donohue Family Stanford Educational Farm.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] Hands down the best class I have taken at Stanford. Patrick is very knowledgable and passionate about all things farm and it was a pleasure to listen to him impart his wisdom. Shout out to Omar for running the best farm section.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] Excellent opportunity to get outside learning practical skills related to organic agriculture (and personal gardening!). Going to the farm twice a week was such a delight. You also have the chance to explore how urban ag interacts with poverty/income and other inequities. I really enjoyed learning about the importance of community to urban ag projects. Also, don't sweat the assignments too much. Ask for help even if you don't know where to start, and try to work on them far enough ahead of time that you're able to enjoy them.", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] Take the course! It's packed full of great knowledge, and the practical elements at the farm are extremely helpful. Patrick Archie is also a wonderful teacher.", "[0.4] [Spring 2021] Such a great way to get to spend time on the farm! It is an antidote to stress."], "URBANST 183": ["[0.95] [Spring 2021] I loved taking this course. URBANST 183 provides an opportunity for students to work together on redesigning sites in an actual urban spaces applying concepts taught in class into practice. This class was a great opportunity and  I thoroughly enjoyed it!", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] Take it! Having taken this class in the pandemic year, it was super chill, but I feel like I missed out a lot on the experience of being in person. Of course, there's obvious things that can't happen online, but Danno is such an accessible and helpful instructor. You can just email him for help and he'll be there to help you work on a project that's actually gonna be out there to make a difference in this world.", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] This is a great opportunity for students who took the intro class to practice additional urban design. For those that didn\u2019t take the intro class, this is a great practical/experiential introduction to urban design.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] Good introduction to urban design for those who have never done it before. It may change quarter to quarter, but I really enjoyed the client and project focus of the quarter. It's not a conventionally-organized class, and you largely get out of it what you put in, but Danno is great and very understanding.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] I had an awesome experience! Danno is a passionate instructor who led us on a wild ride, designing an entire neighborhood and presenting to a San Francisco supervisor in just 10 weeks. It was the perfect way to apply the lessons (and to the same project) from intro class 113, and the group setting was super helpful in throwing around ideas and putting together our plan piece by piece. We took a deep dive into every aspect of urban design, ranging from zoning, to transportation, to housing.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] I would definitely take this class! Danno is such a fun teacher and the projects you work on for this class are all so interesting. It's definitely a plus that you get to work on a project that has real implications outside of the classroom, which is a huge plus for any learning environment.", "[0.3] [Spring 2019] Danno is an incredible person and instructor, this class teaches some really valuable lessons, but if you're looking for a more traditional class, this is not the one for you", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] It's very rare that a studio class allows you to work on a real-life project that has tangible impact on real communities, but this class does exactly that. I came into the class with a little bit of background in urban studies, but throughout the course of ten weeks I have learned a tremendous amount about technical drawing, the values and considerations of an urban designer, and the process of working with a client and the residents to refine a design solution. Seeing our designs being brought by our nonprofit client, NewStory, to the actual communities in Mexico was immensely emotional and rewarding, not to mention the learning and growth I experienced during the collaborative design process with my peers. Highly recommend!", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] This course is so worth it! Danno is so talented and getting the chance to have one on one interactions to learn from him and share your designs with him is wonderful. It is great to see your work be part of something bigger.", "[0.65] [Spring 2017] - Understand that you must be an independent learner to grasp the best skills - You get out as much as you put in", "[1.0] [Spring 2017] This year was the first in the team format, and a lot of kinks need to be worked out. Danno holds a wealth of knowledge, but he tends to ramble and go off on tangents. At times I felt like he imposed his own ideas instead of asking questions that made us think of solutions to what he felt were issues in our approach/design. When we were in studio mode and he'd go from person to person with feedback, he'd tend to go on and on/waste time instead of providing efficient suggestions/thoughts and letting us continue to work. I'm sure the course will improve next year, but a lot of changes need to be made. I appreciated the opportunity to approach a design problem as a group and have flexibility.", "[0.0] [Spring 2017] Take it if you know beforehand what the group project will be.

Also, it is low commitment and minimal work/assignment post class.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2022] Great class! Cool speakers. Able to network with speakers after class.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2022] I enjoyed hearing more about public service careers from experts in a variety of fields. It was refreshing to hear from speakers who pursued a career in public impact similar to my own goals, especially at Stanford where most events are geared towards CS Majors. This is a very quick class, only one hour a day, but it opens you eyes to careers and pathways outside of the Stanford bubble. I highly recommend!", "[0.65] [Autumn 2022] A very low stakes one unit class. The guests were amazing and interesting!", "[0.55] [Autumn 2022] I think the course wasn't for me personally, since the careers of the speakers were so niche. But overall the workload was good/manageable and guest speakers were interesting.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] Super interesting course. Very worth it. As an often directionless humanities student, it helped me concretize the various things I would consider doing with my future and provided some more direction to my studies.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2022] This course was extremely worthwhile if you want to hear from a variety of people from different backgrounds discuss their public service journeys. They also had very interesting general life stories and life advice for us students who are in college.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2022] The range of speakers was terrific and Juliet Brody does a really nice job of interviewing the guests.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] Good if you need a 1-unit.

Although some speakers are extremely engaging, there are cases when the speakers' interests don't line up with your own, so those are not usually as interesting. Still, the wide variety of speakers this course brings is its strong suit!!", "[0.65] [Autumn 2022] The speakers come from a variety of backgrounds and have very good advice about how to approach public service careers! The workload is not too intense. If you are already set on the specific career pathway of public service that interests you most, the class can feel a bit redundant.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] Consider taking the speaker series (1 credit section) of this course even if you're not an undergrad!

I would recommend to take this course later in the undergraduate career (junior or senior) or if you are certain about pursuing a public service career, as there is a very large focus on jobs/post-college in public service.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2022] Very chill seminar that would be great for you if you are in any way interested in public service as a potential career!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] If you are thinking about public service, take it.

Each time she sat down with a guest, her questions were fantastic and drove wonderful conversations. Her ability to redirect quests to the central question of how people found their pathways to public service. But her genuine engagement with the speakers allowed her to ask important and topical follow-up questions as the need arose. Amazing!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] pretty good class if you're looking for a 1 unit speaker series, or a 2 unit filler. For 2 units - the workbook wasn't really helpful, and neither were the classroom discussions. The class functioned much better when the teaching team let students talk amongst themselves or with the DCI mentors they had visit. I wouldn't say that this class drastically changed my perspective on public service careers, but it does encourage engaging with the topic, which can be helpful if you're a junior or senior looking to enter the workforce", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] take it! the staff are so kind and dedicated to helping students, and the speakers are truly interesting. You also learn really important insights into work in public service and social impact and how diverse opportunities are. also make sure you have some sort of direction or interest already or else the workshop part will be stressful. the speaker series are always good.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] Worthwhile! The homework can be a bit of a chore, but fully you get out of it what you put in. Incredibly supportive teaching staff and community of students -- they really go above and beyond to support you. Useful skills that will never be a waste of time.", "[-0.15] [Autumn 2022] They bring in some pretty sick speakers and it's very well moderated, DO NOT take the two-unit version though, section tries to cater to frosh and seniors at the same time and fails everyone.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2022] the teaching staff are incredible and I learned so much in this class! highly recommend it to anyone who is considering a career in public service.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] This is a great way to learn about different jobs for the future! My favorite part was the information interviews we were required to conduct that connected me with so many amazing individuals.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2022] The one-unit portion (speaker series) is low-commitment and a good exposure to different social impact careers. The two-unit option (Thursday seminar) is a bit more work, but I think it was worth it to be able to get more personal feedback and build skills like informational interviewing. That said, Thursday classes seemed disorganized at times, and we weren't always able to get through all the planned material.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2022] Take this course if you're looking to hear from phenomenal speakers!", "[0.6] [Autumn 2022] This class is a great way to familiarize yourself with Stanford's public service career resources and relevant staff, explore potential career ideas, and develop professional skills.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2022] 2 unit class is pretty good, basically how to start planning to resume build for a career in public service 101.", "[0.5] [Autumn 2022] Start organizing the informational interviews ASAP and put effort into them - they are the most helpful part of the class", "[0.5] [Autumn 2022] Really nice class to learn more from public speakers where you get more of an in-depth look into their lives", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] This class is a great one for seniors who are looking to go into public service industry jobs. I highly recommend taking it if you get the chance because you will be exposed to many interesting career paths, learn important job application skills (like resume writing, cover letters, and informational interviews), and it forces you to start the job search. It is a great class to make applying to jobs feel way less scary by the end.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2022] Take this course if you are considering a career in public service.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] Good, but only worth taking for two units. The Thursday discussion sections were great and despite some glaring time management issues I really enjoyed discussing career paths with my peers and got a lot of value out of the assignments. The biggest issue with the Thursday sections was that Prof Litvak would regularly interrupt his colleagues to take three times as long to explain something that had already been brought up. It was astonishingly disrespectful and the primary cause of the Thursday time management issues. The speaker series on Tuesdays were good and bad. Half of the speakers were really interesting and great communicators, but the rest were not. Unfortunately, even for the good speakers, Professor Brodie monopolized 80% of the speaker time with her questions, and she didn't always chose good questions. Her first question to Jendayi Frazer (a prior US assistant secretary of state) was about how she played the flute as a child. Which could have been fine as a cute intro, except for the followup questions that led to the topic taking up more than 10 minutes of \"discussion\" time. These problems are definitely easy to fix though, and I still strongly recommend the course in the two-unit version.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] This class is great for holding you accountable when it comes to starting your job search. The quarter gets so busy, so to get credit for thinking about your future was incredibly helpful for me. They also teach you some helpful skills for navigating this often confusing process.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] 10/10 recommend you will love the engaging speakers and if you take it for 2 units you will gain important skills in the job search world", "[0.75] [Autumn 2022] Take this course if you are unsure where to start in the career/job search! Take this course to meet other peers who also want to go into public service careers. The content is taught by amazing instructors who are knowledgeable about everything public service and are here to help within and outside of class time.", "[0.25] [Winter 2022] It's a very low workload and interesting course! Take it if you want to hear about more jobs related to the government.", "[0.45] [Winter 2022] Don't take this as a senior unless you need an easy two unit", "[0.8] [Winter 2022] This class definitely has some questionable speakers, and misses the opportunity to invite more diverse speakers who would rather work outside of the systems than within them. I really loved all the effort the students and TA's put in, however. If you need a one-unit or two-unit class with very little work, take it, but there are probably better classes out there for that purpose.", "[0.0] [Winter 2022] It offers unique perspectives on Public Policy careers.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] This course has fantastic speakers, and is very well organized~ I highly recommend it if you are interested in learning more about careers in public service.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] This speaker series had a lot of great alumni speakers come and give advice and talk about their careers in social impact and it's a great course to take if you're at all interested in that.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Would definitely recommend taking this course if you're interested in getting exposure to a range of public service careers. I knew I was interested in public service, but I wanted more information about the job options available in order to best suit my interests/abilities. This course helped show me how diverse public service careers can be and provided a lot of valuable advice on the best way to get these jobs and build connections.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] super fun and interesting", "[0.7] [Winter 2022] Interesting class, sparks good career ideas", "[0.45] [Winter 2022] This class is pretty good but is more work than a typical 2 unit course. You will learn as much as you put into it.", "[0.7] [Winter 2022] This course will really give you back what you put into it. It's clear the teaching staff is very invested into it though and willing to help you!", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Take this course! Super interesting seminar and loved hearing from the guest speakers.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Not as helpful for frosh but more helpful for upperclassmen. As a frosh, you will still learn some things but most things won't feel relevant. The informational interviews were helpful at first but six of them were definitely too many. If you're interested in a speaker series, take it for 1 unit. The 2 unit seminar was often not helpful and felt dragged on at times.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Great course to learn about the different options in public service careers. However, if you are deciding between public service careers and more traditional ambitious roles like finance or consulting, the course might seem quite one-dimensional, not concentrating properly on the opportunity cost of pursuing public service careers.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] super helpful class, definitely pushed me to think more deeply about public service work and provided me with concrete information about what a career in that world would look like.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] If you are at all interested in working in the public sector definitely take this course!! The speakers are all very accomplished in their respective fields and are willing to answer any questions, so take advantage of that!", "[0.8] [Winter 2022] it's a great course to gain new information on the public service sector", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] This is a great and insightful class to take if you are a junior or senior. I feel like it doesn't help as much if you are early on in your career because the stakes aren't as high and you may not want to be doing job search stuff yet. With the informational interviews, thank you notes, and class exercises, it sometimes feels like you are putting more than 2-units worth of work, so also take that into consideration.", "[0.45] [Winter 2022] Although the premise of the class sounds great- many of the speakers weren't all that engaging and it became a chore to go to class", "[1.0] [Winter 2022] This is a great speaker series for students who are considering careers in public service, but it is probably most useful to younger students who have a general interest and want to hone in on a particular career option or path rather than students who already know what type of work they want to be doing. Nonetheless, all of the speakers are excellent, and often provide great advice.", "[0.45] [Winter 2022] The speakers are all very informative and have very interesting backgrounds", "[0.0] [Winter 2022] If you need an extra unit take it, otherwise don't take it.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] This course was really personalized to each student; the instructors are really helpful and approachable and genuinely care about each student's success. I learned a lot of valuable skills including how to leverage my unique skills and interests, how to pitch myself to prospective employees, how to write an effective cover letter and resume, and how to research potential jobs. The speaker series was really insightful and interesting and always a nice part of my week.", "[0.45] [Winter 2022] It helps you plan out and be specific on what you want to do with your life by asking fundamental questions in regards to life", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] I took this class hoping to learn more about what sort of careers are out there for someone who is interested in public service and/or social impact. The course did a great job in bringing a variety of speakers, many of whom with ties to Stanford, to tell us about their career paths. Would definitely recommend if you want to see what kind of pathways are out there. Not all speakers were of the same quality but on average all were pretty good! Not a huge time commitment.", "[0.6] [Winter 2022] I would strongly recommend taking the class!", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] This is a great class with a lot of variety in terms of people in the public service sector. You will get lots of support and opinions to help and guide your job search.", "[0.3] [Winter 2022] Take it! I took this course to try to force myself to actually decide what I wanted to do for my career. I didn't know that I would also be required to do informational interviews, conduct job searches and do activities that really forced me to focus my path- I loved it!", "[0.4] [Winter 2022] Take it if you are a underclassman undergrad student looking for direction and are interested in social impact work.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] I think it's a great option if you might want to work in public service! It's a low time commitment, and you learn a lot of useful things! I'd recommend doing it for two units -- it doesn't add much work or time, and it's a great way to gain a better idea of what your future in public service might look like and to meet other people involved in it.", "[0.7] [Winter 2022] It\u2019s a good course if you\u2019re interested in learning how to incorporate public service in your career, especially if you\u2019re poli sci", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] I say take it if you are starting to think critically about your future and want the chance to explore different fields within social impact work. The more effort you put into the class, the more you get out of it. The class had a lot of diverse speakers come talk, and the teaching team was overall supportive in allowing us to think critically about our careers. Make sure you do the informational interviews on time as that's what I felt was most useful from the course if you're taking it for 2 units.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] Highly recommend for anyone remotely interested in a career in public service or social impact. Lots of great insight not available elsewhere.", "[0.6] [Winter 2022] Go for it, I was pleasantly surprised at the caliber of speakers.", "[0.4] [Winter 2022] Take this class to learn about yourself and get units for exploring your interests!!", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Very useful if you're an underclassman, slightly useful if you're an upperclassman. The best thing this course taught me was how to use the Stanford network to your advantage.", "[0.7] [Winter 2022] This is a great course to take if you feel stressed about future career options or just want to hear the career paths of some interesting alumni!", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] I loved the variety of speakers. It wasn't just alumni who work in non-profits but also ones who work in government. It wasn't just the veteran accomplished folks but also younger ones who could give advice that we could employ right away. I definitely recommend. Not a lot of work, but a ton to learn.", "[0.5] [Winter 2022] Take it! It's an easy unit and very insightful.", "[0.35] [Winter 2022] Definitely would recommend this class if you're interested in any public service major or even anything in the humanities but you're still unsure about what you want to do. It helped me narrow down my options.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] This is a fantastic course for anyone interested in social impact careers. The instructors are very passionate and are always ready to help. You learn the tools to approach the job search and also spend time critically evaluating your own career plans.", "[0.55] [Spring 2021] Take it at least a year before your graduation! The earlier the better, especially if you're an international student and not familiar with US job-seeking procedures!", "[0.85] [Spring 2021] Take this class! It's a great way to learn about impactful job paths and move away from the typical jobs Stanford students get after graduation. This class inspired me to discover new ways of applying my hobbies and interests, which is unique to this class.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] I would say that this class is most valuable for upperclassmen who will be using these skills immediately to find jobs. You will get out what you put in - the most valuable lesson will come from the self-reflective and life-planning exercises so the more time you can devote to these, the more you will gain. Also - keep record of all the panelists contacts and send follow-up emails to those whose fields/positions are interesting to you!", "[0.7] [Spring 2021] Highly recommend- it fast tracks you into figuring out who you are & who you want to be & how that translates into a career. Might recommend for folks later in their Stanford careers (Sophomore Spring/Junior Year/Senior Year)", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] Highly recommend to anyone considered public service and social impact careers! Especially great for someone who is about to embark on their job search. This is a structured opportunity for students to reflect on their interests and goals and find concrete ways to explore possibilities. This course also allows students to develop skills and techniques for the job search and provides confidence in embarking on this journey.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] Super helpful class for clarifying your career goals and preparing for the job search. The panelists are great and the in-class activities are very practical and useful.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] Super helpful course for someone who's trying to figure out a social impact career. Also super helpful to just think through different considerations you have with potential careers. Also nice to work through interview tips and resume and network building.", "[1.0] [Spring 2021] I liked this class. My favorite parts were the panelists and the coaching sessions we got. From a job hunting perspective, I learned how to better tailor my cover letter and read a job description to find what the employer really wanted. I also learned how to better answer interview questions. And most importantly, I learned how awesome of a resource the Haas Center and BEAM are. From a career perspective, I loved hearing from so many different people who work in social impact careers. It was cool to hear from professionals who were mission and values-driven and learn about how they got to where they are and how they actively live by their values in their jobs. I also liked how the teaching team was large and each person had a different background, so I got lots of different advice from each person. The only thing I didn't like about this class was that it was one two-hour chunk every Friday afternoon. I was so tired from the week that it was hard to stay engaged all the time.", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] Lots of great reasons to take this low workload, high impact class: great panelists from all sorts of different social impact careers, practical job search and interview insights, and a cool community with peers who are also seeking out ways to make a positive difference.

There are many more hands-on assignments, so you will need to keep track of everything you have to do from the beginning (some of the assignments snuck up on me!).  I always feel, however, that the work I am doing is meaningful!  Showing up to class each week, I am consistently inspired by the people around me and their amazing projects.  They inspire me to work harder on my own thesis and produce something that is really meaningful.", "[0.7] [Winter 2018] I would definitely consider applying to be a public service scholar.

The topics for this class may seem foreign and irrelevant at first for STEM students. However, I believe they will also benefit from learning about public service in a deep, thought-provoking way, which is something that most people working in the STEM field often miss. Just remember to be open-minded and ready to learn about new perspectives and new schools of thought.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2017] This class has totally changed my perspective on public service (in a good way) and has also strengthened my conviction in being involved in social impact after graduation.  Clayton and the PSSP students are so incredibly supportive and they have definitely been a source of moral support throughout the arduous thesis-writing process.  They have also challenged me to reflect on the role of social impact in my thesis, which has shaped my arguments and objectives.  The only thing is I would prefer to have a different class time (perhaps earlier in the week), as Thursday evenings are when lots of senior activities are happening.  Overall, such a great class - would definitely recommend!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] PSSP has been one of the best academic spaces on campus for me.

It's great for keeping you accountable throughout this process. You don't need to come into the class with a research question in mind, but there isn't a ton of time to spare before assignments start picking up and you essentially have to decide. That being said, you can change your topic mid-quarter if needed.

He takes you through the learning process so slowly and nicely that you don't even realize how much you're absorbing.

Planning, writing, and editing a full research paper (within 10 weeks) was an incredibly useful and challenging experience.  I really enjoyed learning with/from the rest of the urban studies cohort and watching everyone's projects evolve.  Going into the course, I took the advice of previous students and tried to work as efficiently as possible at the start of the quarter.  I collected and processed my data over the summer and had the main body of the paper drafted by the end of week 5.  I HIGHLY recommend this approach, if you can swing it, because it has given me much more time to carefully edit my paper with less stress.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2020] You have to hold yourself accountable to actually sit down and work on your research.

It's helpful to be ready to learn about coding and findings sections at the time that they're taught in the quarter! - WRITE! Even if it sucks, just get it down on paper! You will feel so relieved and the paper will get e a s i e r once you stop worrying about making everything \"good\" the first time. - try to stick to the deadlines; they're hard but they'll keep you on track, and you'll be thankful when the end of the quarter rolls around. - you got this! don't lose hope, friend", "[0.9] [Autumn 2020] Please try to come in with a question that you feel proud to answer because that will make life so much easier!

If you can do your data collection over the summer - do it. It will make your life so much easier. The course basically forces you to write your paper, which is helpful, but it can also be very stressful to hit deadline goals. Good luck!", "[0.25] [Autumn 2019] i really liked the organization of the course (self-designed assingments that you have to hold yourself accountable to) but this class is a lot of work if you haven't done work or data collection before the fall.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2018] It's required technically, but consider it required (read: absolutely necessary) if you want to do a successful senior project or thesis", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] Michael is a great instructor and he will push you to create an argument that is comprehensive and thoughtful. Take advantage of going to office hours, Michael is really willing to sit down with you and walk you through anything you might be struggling with. You'll be in a good position if you stay on track of the assignments you make for yourself at the beginning of the quarter.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2018] Make a plan for using your time this quarter-- sometimes your data collection this summer didn't go as planned, or your research project changes. But it will be useful to you to stick to a writing plan. Also, for assignments A, B, C, make one of them a lit review, one a methods, even if you still need to collect data. This will help you over thanksgiving break so you don't have to write 30 pages while avoiding helping cook.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2018] If you want to be pushed out of your comfort zone and get a head start on your thesis, I would definitely recommend this class.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] Although I took this as a required course for the Urban Studies major, I understand why such a course is required. Narrowing down our research topics to outlining our thesis or capstones section by section every week has been truly helpful. For any future students, I highly recommend sitting down with your topic at the beginning of the quarter and figure out the following key points: (a) If you are doing a capstone or thesis, (b) how much of each you plan to realistically complete in one quarter (you have to finish all the capstone or part of the thesis), and (c) how much data or progress you have already completed for your project. Although 10 weeks seems like a good chunk of time to work on your project, I do wish I focused more on completing my assignments and projects earlier in the quarter before the later half of the quarter.", "[-0.6] [Autumn 2018] Don't be afraid to ask questions and take risks. We're all fairly new to this and there is no shame in mistakes or struggling with your project.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2017] This class is a TON of work. It practically consumed my quarter. However, it was simply a fabulous intellectual experience. Michael is so good (too good even) at his job. His care, willingness to help, and insightful feedback were invaluable. He's the best. If you're willing to put in the necessary hours, you'll come out of this course with an awesome final project: a fleshed out research paper on a topic that you care about. Plan your assignments A, B, and C wisely! Don't get too ambitious! And give yourself time to work through each assignment diligently, never wait until the last minute.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] Take it--it'll be useful in growing as a scholar and as a student. If you're writing an honors thesis, it is especially helpful to take; it'll help in formulating, formatting, and organizing your thoughts.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] This course was really helpful in pushing you to work toward your project. As a student who is writing an honors thesis the structure and flexibility that this course offered was really important in helping me set a solid foundation for working on my thesis for the rest of the school year.", "[-0.2] [Autumn 2017] Take it, and work hard. You might just have a full draft of a thesis at the end!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2017] Michael does a great job of teaching this class. As long as you remain invested in your own work and communicate clearly and effectively about your goals and where you might be failing to reach your goals, the class allows you to create a capstone or the beginning of a thesis with great success. There's so much one on one support and I think that's the best part.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2017] Try to come in with as much research already done as possible!", "[0.75] [Autumn 2017] I would say that while the research process seems daunting, the course is a good way for students to be held accountable and be supported throughout. I would also note that while it is not impossible to start from scratch at the beginning of the course, having a launching point at the beginning (potentially some data collected) will allow them to make the most out of the course", "[0.95] [Autumn 2017] This course (albeit a requirement for Urban Studies seniors) is definitely worth taking. I was surprised by how much I learned from analyzing the work and writing style of the model scholar. Michael provides helpful, honest feedback, which is necessary to develop your best possible paper. This class is a fair amount of work, but it is enjoyable because everything you do it working towards your capstone project or honors thesis. Be warned that, if you take this class as well as an honors-specific course at the same time, you are in for a LOT of writing!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2017] Block out an ample amount of time to work on your research. While it's 5 units, a lot of students and I agree that it was quite a lot of work, though not in a negative way. It's a great space to take ownership of your own academic project on campus with like-minded peers, and that takes a lot of good effort and time.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2017] Start writing the body of your paper early!", "[1.0] [Autumn 2017] It's a good chance to identify where your strengths are as a writer, and where there's room for improvement. Take advantage of the office hours and meetings with Michael and the TA for the course and come prepared with specific questions about your work. Coming in with a set of questions will help you direct the conversation and will help you get the most out of the short sessions you have scheduled. Michael and Lauren will also have their comments to share as well, so it'll be helpful to walk away with both your questions answered/concerns addressed as well as hearing their feedback."], "URBANST 27Q": ["[0.0] [Autumn 2022] It's not the best organized class ever. Class discussions tend to go off the rails, and it wasn't a ton of fun.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2022] The class is a great time and Professor Stout definitely knows what he's talking about. My only complaint is that he tends to veer off into tangents a lot, most of the time they are actually pretty interesting but it kinda derails the conversation.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] I loved this class! Professor Stout is so nice and cares about the students. I loved the different readings and the themes were discussed were interesting.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2022] Definitely consider taking this course, you should be expecting a lot of discussion regarding detective fiction but there will also be a lot of discussion regarding urban environments and the city as well.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] This was such a fascinating class! I learned a lot about cities and got to read amazing detective novels and stories for class. So many of the things I learned tied in to other areas of interest, so it really just felt like a well-rounded approach to a few of the facets of urban studies. Professor Stout is great, and really helped me develop ideas for my final paper, which I enjoyed writing because the topic was interesting to me. Lectures are very interesting, but can sometimes feel a little long. Overall a great class that I would definitely recommend.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] This is a super interesting class if you are someone who is passionate about detective fiction. Professor Stout is extremely knowledgeable in urban studies in general, so you will get a lot of background info in that field as well. The workload is super reasonable and the readings are well chosen, and the final project is a fun one if you choose a topic you are interested in.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] Frederic Stout is a fun guy to listen to. When he gets going and he's passionate about it, it is truly an enjoyable experience. However, he will sometimes get off-topic, or repeat things he has mentioned in previous lectures, which can annoy some people. On the other hand, he is more than willing to let you interrupt him and tell him to get back on track. The class was often polarizing: either extremely engaging in terms of conversation, or nobody spoke and it was just Professor Stout speaking the entire time. While this primarily depends on who ends up taking the seminar with you, I would say that this class was not too intensive in terms of amount of work, and was generally engaging. However, do be warned that Professor Stout has been the harshest teacher I have ever had in terms of grammatical syntax, literary essay composition, and style guidelines. He will not be afraid to mark down for small mistakes, and whilst I do appreciate how much I learn, I sometimes felt that decrease in grade was harsh for the mistake made, especially given how people coming in will have varying degrees of experience with such writing. Besides these expectations, I did thoroughly enjoy the class, and would recommend it to anyone interested in the city or detective fiction.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] If you're interested in detective fiction, you'll probably enjoy the chance to discuss a lot of interesting books along some like-minded peers.", "[-0.05] [Autumn 2021] It is very easy and the reading is manageable. The readings are not very diverse which makes them feel repetitive by the end of the course. He has some very outdated thoughts both on instruction and some social issues which can make the discussions exhausting sometimes. He will also publicly go over your paper in front of the class (for better or for worse) which caused a good amount of embarrassment unnecessarily. It wasn't really that much of a discussion, more of a lecture, but I didn't mind because I didn't have that many thoughts on the readings and couldn't sustain discussion for 3 hours a week.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Professor Stout is quite the character. He's got a lot to say about everything and often that cuts into class discussions. I personally enjoyed many of the tangents he went on but I know others in the class did not. At the very least, the readings are interesting, consisting of a number of detective stories. Some of the assigned reading can get quite long, so spacing out over a few days can't hurt, and it's enjoyable to read anyway. There are a few one-page papers throughout the quarter, and a final 10-page paper. The professor is very flexible so you can write about anything tangentially related to the subject, and you don't really have to worry about grades with this class. Overall, an enjoyable experience.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] I highly recommend this course to anyone who love reading detective fiction.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] The readings are very fun and interesting and it's enjoyable to relate those to issues with technology and modern cities.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] This is a very chill, laid back course where you can explore anything you want that's somehow related to detective fiction. Sometimes it can feel a bit lecture heavy but classes have a very low-stakes, comfortable atmosphere where you can participate as much as you want in discussion. Professor Stout has a very interesting life too and it was really fun hearing his stories.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2020] Amazing class with a great teacher. Lots of learning and chances to research what you are interested in!", "[0.4] [Autumn 2020] Be as present as you possibly can during class. If not, it is painful when most of the class is disengaged and the discussion is flat as the material for the class is very interesting but often not discussed enough.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] Definitely take it! The readings were really fun and interesting, the discussions were insightful and the professor is super knowledgeable and passionate about the subject.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2020] While the lectures may go off in a tangent occasionally, Professor Stout is a wonderful person and him alone is worth taking the introsem.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2020] Take it! Prof. Stout it really nice, and he wants the best for his students.  He tries really hard to connect topics and make this class fun.  He makes you think about the reading in ways you might not've before.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2020] It is an interesting course informationally, but I don't think it is where you would \"discover\" a passion.", "[0.35] [Autumn 2020] Space out your reading and get a good idea for your final paper early on to ease the burden of working too much on your final paper at the end of the quarter.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2020] Fun class, not a huge time commitment, but Zoom made it really hard to engage in discussion.", "[0.6] [Spring 2020] Good for WAYS requirement, books are okay and not too much work. Not the best introsem not the worst.", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] Definitely take it! It's a little reading-heavy but the books are all very enjoyable. Not a lot of work besides reading--we had two 1-page papers due throughout the quarter, and one bigger final paper due at the end. Professor Stout is very knowledgeable and friendly, and this class was one of my favorites! A great break from more stressful classes.", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] The readings are very fun and enjoyable.  I recommend this to anyone who likes detective fiction or wants to learn more about it, Professor Stout is rather knowledgable and well read.", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] Taking this class with Fred has genuinely been one of the highlights of my Stanford experience. Our afternoon discussions are a fun way to de-stress and just have fun talking about detective fiction. The reading list was excellent as well, especially Death of a Red Heroine.", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] I LOVED IT!

You are given much flexibility on the research paper, so avail yourself of this independence, and make sure to actively participate in discussions to shape the course of the seminar!", "[0.9] [Spring 2018] Take it!!! I'm usually not a big fan of seminars but Professor Stout is so chill it made it worthwhile. Each class just feels like a lazy afternoon talk with friends. Very low time commitment too.", "[0.9] [Spring 2018] Very interesting and fun class, the books you read are excellent.", "[0.95] [Winter 2017] I like to read detective fiction, and this course certainly increased my appreciation of the genre. I enjoyed reading the Sherlock Holmes stories, Hammett's The Maltese Falcon, and Chandler's The Big Sleep, and examining how these novels comment on the urban environment. Professor Stout is extremely knowledgable about the genre. Although he sometimes strays from the day's discussion topic, the information he provides is always fascinating. Ultimately, this class gave me new insight into both the popularity of detective fiction and the impact of the city on culture.", "[0.9] [Winter 2017] Professor Stout is one of the most interesting professors on campus. This class was chill, and a great opportunity to discuss interests.", "[0.95] [Winter 2017] Definitely Take. Dr. Stout is a fantastic professor and really nice guy. Huge wealth of knowledge.", "[0.95] [Winter 2017] Take it!! Dr. Stout is amazing. The discussions in the class are super great, but, more importantly, you get to know a really cool guy with a ton of awesome life experience.", "[1.0] [Winter 2017] I loved this class--one of my favorites at Stanford. The readings were all super interesting, and Professor Stout knew how to engage students in discussions. I also really enjoyed the creative freedom we had to pursue our research papers. Take it!!"], "URBANST 65SI": [], "URBANST 66Q": [], "URBANST 7": [], "URBANST 83N": ["[0.3] [Autumn 2022] Make sure to read the essays and understand the analytical concepts in them.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] It's a very interesting course about a fascinating intersection of topics. It's also a ton of fun to be able to watch clips of movies in addition to reading works of literature. Definitely put in the work (do the readings, come prepared, etc.) to have a fulfilling experience in the class.", "[0.2] [Autumn 2022] This class is a lot of reading, and at times, it feels difficult to connect with the professor. We spend very little time talking about the readings considering how much reading we have to do. The subject of the course is certainly interesting, but I felt we could've explored the class concepts more productively.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2022] Please be advised that this class has a lot of reading. We were required to read one book a week, sometimes two books a week, on top of watching a YouTube lecture and additional academic papers. I learned a lot from this class about interpretations of space in media, but wished we were given more time to go more deeply into exploring the texts. The class size is quite small and allows you to ask a lot of question and engage with the professor.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] Take. This. Course. The content is so fascinating that even the STEM kids end up enjoying it. And yes, Quayson is a tough grader. But he's also fair, enthusiastic, and hilarious... Definitely one of my favorite professors! A word for the wise: give yourself enough time to read the books... ESPECIALLY \"Mrs. Dalloway.\" You'll get more out of the class if you hone in on the readings! Perfect for future Humanities majors.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] Personally I had a difficult time in this class. Professor Quayson, although extremely knowledgeable and a great lecturer, was quite strict with definitions and analysis of course materials. So, although this was an English class, it felt like any interpretation of a materials was definitively right or wrong. Since wrong answers were dismissed immediately in class, it sometimes felt difficult to contribute to discussions or to do well on assignments drawing on course material. Additionally, there was quite a bit of reading or other material to consume for homework before each class (often a whole novel, lecture, and essay to read each week) which would stack on top of the essay writing assignments we were given. Because of the sheer amount of material covered, I didn't feel that we went into any of it very deeply and it would have been really helpful if we had specific chapters or sections to read instead. Since certain vocabulary sometimes were not fully explained and essay assignments were quite vague, I also highly recommend scheduling office hour time with Professor Quayson to stay on top of work and understand his expectations. All this being said, I did learn a lot in this class and we covered a lot of fascinating material.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] We barely covered the science fiction section, and had to write an essay about it. Prof. Quayson is a good lecturer and there were fun class discussions, but he has favorites. Feedback was not always clear. Still, interesting course material and interesting trips.", "[0.45] [Winter 2022] Class involves lots of reading and is discussion-heavy. Interesting topics and readings--worth every second!", "[0.6] [Winter 2022] This is a great introduction to literature, and the idea of time and space as a tool to convey messages.", "[0.65] [Winter 2022] Great class. Start readings and assignments early and ask questions!", "[1.0] [Winter 2022] I really enjoyed this course! It was definitely more of an english class than I went in expecting but I learned a lot from the course! Professor Quayson is very kind and passionate about the subject though I think he lectures quite a bit during class. I really loved the class field trip, the tree tour, and the last two writing assignments in the class (spatial analysis of a place you are familiar with and the science fiction assignment) were fun and creative! This class was a lot of work but was very interesting and genuinely makes me think about the space differently in my everyday life.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Professor Quayson is an amazing professor who is approachable and up-to-date, but he definitely holds to high standards. I enjoyed the first half of the class. The second is a bit more haphazard due to events this quarter and changing schedule.", "[0.05] [Winter 2022] This class was very disappointing. Professor Quayson is an amazing academic, but I thought the class was going to involve a little more concrete urban studies material. It was all very theoretical, and we didn't learn much vocabulary after the first few weeks. Also, when we discussed literature sometimes, the talks would not even involve urban studies at all. Overall, this class is a lot of reading for very little pay-off, and the essays are harshly graded without any commentary or reason (graded out of 10).", "[-0.4] [Winter 2022] This class is extremely difficult and graded harshly.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] This is a super interesting class! There is a lot of reading assigned, however given the specific focus of the class, it is okay to skim over lots of content in the books in favor of focusing on descriptions of space and time.", "[1.0] [Winter 2022] It was really exciting and interesting to learn about concepts like chronotopes, spatial traversal, and spatial analysis -- They totally allowed me to reshape my understanding of location and space. I'd never heard of them before and it was fun to use literature and movies to understand these core urban studies concepts. The section on science fiction was a lot more muddy and less well-explained.\n\nI will note though that Quayson sometimes doesn't explain assignments super clearly, and you should always ask for more details on what he wants. Also, he doesn't always define the new terms that he uses, so be sure to always understand the definitions before you write about certain topics. One other qualm I have is that at some points it felt more like an English class than an urban studies class, as Quayson talked more about analyzing character motivations than the space itself. \n\nOverall, really really wonderful class. Quayson is very passionate and engaging. I really recommend it for anyone interested in urban studies or the topic. It's made me really interested in the major and I will continue to take classes in the major.\n\nALSO \u2014  we went on a trip to SF at the end, and it was super fun and informative. Definitely a highlight. Quayson took us to the top of a hill and we got a view of the city and noted various things about the city design and layout. then we went to the SF Moma. It was awesome.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2020] A really interesting course with great reading and commentary from Professor Quayson that supplement understanding of material, but be prepared for demanding workload and challenging discussions.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2020] This is a super interesting class! Made my think about my surroundings in a way I'd never have thought to before, and I loved our class discussions so much. Quayson is a phenomenal mind who is absolutely fascinating to listen to; his love for the material is always apparent.  Be prepared for a pretty legit workload, and always come to class prepared. The more you put in the more you get out. The grading on papers can be a bit of an adjustment, so take advantage of office hours to try to grow from each assignment.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2020] Professor Quayson is an excellent instructor who thoroughly explains the spatial concepts that are likely new to all the students. The readings and concepts of the course are engaging and informative. The workload is not too overwhelming and always brings the development of many new skills. The zoom setup is organized and allows for thoughtful discussion from everyone.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2020] ATO is the best!!! This course was a lot of fun, Ato begins each class by asking everyone how they're doing and then we all vibe to music. The content is really interesting and the books we read were great. The workload isn't crazy but make sure you get your papers in on time!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2020] I highly recommend this course! Dr. Quayson is amazing and such an interesting professor. Just understand that there is basically a book due every week and prepare for that in your schedule.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2020] It will teach you to read books and view film in a new way that can impact your everyday life.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] Definitely take it, as long as you are willing to read a lot for the course. The professor is great - friendly, very funny, approachable. The topics discussed in class are extremely interesting and sometimes quite perplexing (Garden of Forking Paths). If you enjoy literature, give this course a try and use it to gain insight into the field of urban studies.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2020] It's a lot of work, but if you're truly passionate about the subject it's worth it.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2020] This is a very interesting course and I would highly reccomend!

It's worth it if you really only want to deal with the class being 1x/week and not having any real work (everything is pretty easy to do in like 10 min), but just know the class itself is extremely boring for like 2 hours and you can't really do other work at the same time, so you basically just have to sit there. I needed my CE credit and am glad I did this instead of taking something that met multiple times a week b/c of my schedule, but if I had a lighter courseload and there was a diff CE class that was something I was interested in, I definitely would have taken that again.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] This is a great class to fill WAYS-CE, but you'll also learn a lot along the way.

Not a ton of work. The intimate readings and practice journals were a nice weekly check in with myself and I do feel that I learned some pretty valuable lessons from class (embodiment, belonging, inner critic). That being said, I did not love the profile assignment (which is half our grade). Some class sessions I really enjoyed - it was nice to have group meditation, learn about yoga, think about our own social circles and place in the community. Some sessions I really did not enjoy - for instance, when we broke into smaller family groups everyone was very negative, including my group leader.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] I really recommend this course.

The administration seems a bit subjective but a great way to check off the CE ways credit.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] Overall a cool class, you definitely get a better understanding of your own feelings and learning to improve your mental health and relationships going forward. At times it could feel like a lot - sometimes classes drag on for a little too long, the profile assignment can feel like a lot of work for a 2-unit class - but I would recommend to anyone interested or needing to get CE credits out of the way.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] I found this class to be unhelpful. It's an easy CE credit which is why I took it, and I'm happy I found a way to get that requirement. However, it assumes you need these \"skills\" they teach and have poor life skills to cope with mental health. Also they make you meditate every class lol", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] Amazing class, highly recommend, you can also fulfill your CE if you take it for 2 units, not a lot of work but the teaching team is AMAZING and wants you to learn and feel supported", "[0.6] [Autumn 2022] This course is a great way to get the CE requirement and learn about how to be happy.

Amazing teaching staff! Everyone is so incredibly loving and it might open you up to a different experience here at Stanford. The class has a good amount of work for a lower unit course but nothing that will drive you crazy. So yes there\u2019s a good amount of work but nothing that is going to in any way tip the edge.

It introduces many practices to support your well-being at Stanford. However, if you are looking for a community of students focused on centering their mental well-being at Stanford, this is not the place. It feels like most students are there to fulfill their CE requirements, not explore well-being.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2022] This is a really nice, well-taught class that gives you the chance to self-reflect and gives you tools to approach stress. They break the class up into many smaller segments focused on different topics/activities/etc that are taught by different people which keeps it really engaging.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2022] It's a good time", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] Take it!

I always looked forward to going to this class; I knew the energy would be good and that I'd walk out feeling better that day. I think a lot of people could benefit from a course like this, and I would absolutely recommend checking it out. I wouldn't call it life-changing for me personally, but I will definitely continue using a lot of lessons/practices I learned.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] Probably was the healthiest way for me to satisfy WAYS-CE. It's definitely not a stressful class, and some of the weekly practices (like journaling) really can help you with self-care during the quarter. Sometimes the meditation practices in the course really didn't work for me, but I still felt okay, and there were still activities and units that made me feel fine.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] This was the first wellness class I have taken at Stanford, and it was an absolutely phenomenal experience. Learning practices for living presently, managing my emotions, engaging meaningfully with others, and understanding myself proved to be way, way more applicable in my life than I had initially assumed. The class was always fun and interesting, and I loved the experiences we shared together: storytelling, peacemaking, chatting in pods--it was all so lovely. The instructors are incredibly kind and accommodating, which made me feel warm and welcomed in this class.

It would be a good idea to prioritize more courses like this. It is a huge need.", "[0.15] [Spring 2022] It's a really chill course. As long as you go to class and submit your journal each week, you'll be fine. However, If you struggle with class attendance, I wouldn't recommend taking it as it's something they're pretty strict about.", "[0.3] [Spring 2022] Ok class", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] NA, but I think the teaching team could educate more about the idea of privilege and how stress/anxiety often stems from lack of privilege or from institutional structures. the \"habits\" learned in this class are not fix-all things, and definitely not \"resources for hard times.\" think the practices should be better framed as wellness habits for temporary relief, not long-term healing.", "[0.6] [Spring 2022] I loved the course. If I could take it every quarter, I would.", "[0.55] [Spring 2022] This course is very useful for all people.

Not too much work, good for CE. If you come in ready to share and be vulnerable, it'll be way better. If you don't want to share, you won't be forced to, but it also probably will be less meaningful", "[0.4] [Autumn 2021] This class is a nice break from all the other classes at Stanford, and gives you an allotted time to reflect.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] This is a really good way to step away from a lot that is stressful at Stanford and have meaningful conversations. It is also great the it fulfills CE for Ways.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] The staff and students in this class were amazing. I had to miss several classes due to traveling for athletics, and the staff was very accommodating and created meeting times for us to resolve the issue. I loved the content and recommend everyone to take the course. While I originally took it to fulfill a requirement, I gained a lot more from it.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Definitely take this course! Especially if you are interested in wellness and managing your stress, its very helpful, interesting, and the professors are amazing. The course is very informal and casual, really lets you be who you are and exposes you to important skills to use in everyday life.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2021] Good class, especially to fulfill WAYS", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Having a course like this is pretty special at Stanford, where it's often hard to find the time and space to slow down, breathe and reflect upon everything that's happening. I learned a lot of mediation techniques and practices in this course, as well as just thinking about good questions that helped me understand myself a little better. And it's so cool to talk to the people in this course during discussions and feel a sense of connection in how so many other people are going through challenges that are similar, if not the same as yours. Only downside of this course is that it's Friday afternoons, but I always leave the class feeling a little calmer, more at peace", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] This class was a breath of fresh air during each of my weeks.

I highly recommend this class to any Stanford student. The teaching team are extremely kind and talented individuals who truly care about each one of us. I learned many new skills that have helped me through a very hard time, and are even more relevant after the pandemic and that could be useful for everyone.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2021] Take it!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] This is a wonderful class; I think the teaching team is really receptive to feedback and has incredible insights on mindfulness and wellness. However, when I took the class, it lacked some of the critique of systemic oppression that I feel is needed to give a balanced assessment of what wellness looks like in a university setting", "[-0.25] [Autumn 2021] Take it, and go to classes and learn the content, especially if you're a STEM major.\nIt's not a huge commitment, probably the lightest load I've experienced in a class at Stanford, but the return you get in your personal life if you focus in those few hours is immense.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] Interesting readings, kind teaching staff, and the chance to reflect!", "[0.0] [Autumn 2021] Take it!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Overall, I liked the class. The teaching team was really sweet and compassionate which made the experience nice. It was a cool community, but some of the activities are definitely a little uncomfortable and push you out of your comfort zone. I decided to stick with it for the GER that it offered. Can be very helpful and impactful for some people.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] You will learn about a wide variety of life practices; in spring 2021 I learned joy, gratitude, and reflective practices have helped me reconnect with aspects of my childhood, family, and myself.

I see the intention, but I will say they expect a lot of work for being a 1 unit class.

There's great psych / medical research on this question.\n\nHowever, the course's approach is extremely hand-wavy --- I was expecting to read some academic papers, and ideally selections from a couple behavior change books, etc. Instead, this course only has one book (self-help book Tiny Habits), and the lectures (which don't follow the book) are pretty non-academic / pseudo-science-y (to illustrate, we spent 3 weeks talking to each other about how we \"feel\" about behavior change, a week on self-compassion, and a week on yoga). Basically, this is not an academic course. :) Again, not inherently bad! Just personally not something I would have paid for had I realized. (Maybe this should be made more clear in the course description).\n\nI'll also note that I was pretty uncomfortable with the way this course seems to claim \"one true path\" to behavior change (i.e., follow B.J.

More work than any other 1 unit class I've taken.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2017] If you question yourself what career path to take, whether to change the current major/career path, what job is good for you or what job to take, definitely take this course. It will help you explore many things about your personal traits and career/call search. The essays are extremely helpful, as well as readings, and meetings one-on-one with instructors. I've learned so much about myself and understood why some career paths that I thought about before were not suitable for me (before, I just couldn't put into words why I felt there was something missing in them for me). Also, it is just fun, not much work at all, and great classmates!", "[0.1] [Autumn 2017] If you need a course to sit back and think about what you want to do with your life, this is the course for you. If you need a course for practical skills and harder career resources, this may not be the right place.

Many assignments, especially those from the Wayfinder Project, are good. The time required to really do this course as designed is more than the suggested units implies. Also, the classroom at the Farm is a nice change of pace.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] This class is the BEST class I have taken at Stanford; it genuinely changed my life. Katia is a fantastic instructor and a wonderful person, and all the other people in this course were so wonderful, genuine, and caring; over the quarter, the class truly becomes like a little family. Having class on the farm is also amazing, and enhances the deep contemplation being done in class. In the beginning, it felt like a surprising amount of work for a 1-2 unit class; but over time, I came to appreciate every workbook exercise, reading/video, and practice that we engaged with. The course honestly changed me as a person - it taught me so much about myself, and deepened my connections to the people and the world around me. After taking it, I feel empowered to shape the course of my life, and I'm excited to continue living with more compassion, wisdom, meaning, and of course, purpose. I could not recommend this class more - TAKE IT!", "[0.65] [Autumn 2022] really great course if you are looking to do some inner reflection. decent amount of work outside the classroom", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] Worth taking! It's a delightful experience to be at the Educational Farm and discussing big, meaningful questions for our lives with undergraduates, graduates and DCIs.

It is a very experiential course and demands quite a lot in terms of preparation for class.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2022] Do it! You get out what you put in though, so a great class to take during an easy quarter.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] It's a great course that you should definitely take! It is a great opportunity to meet people from all different backgrounds and have one on one personal conversations.", "[0.95] [Summer 2022] This is a great course to take. The instructor is very sweet and is a relaxing course whilst being able to learn more about yourself.

Be prepared to do work outside of class though- it\u2019s a fair bit of work outside of class time.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] Take it!

And even if you think you \"have done this stuff before\", the focus on inward reflection for outward action may be unique and the safe open intergenerational discussion space will definitely generate new learnings.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] You must take this course! Often, it is so easy to lose track of your values, meaning, and purpose, while at Stanford. This class will give you an opportunity to reflect on who you are and provide a sense of direction for where you want to go. You really get what you put into this. One of the best courses at Stanford and the community we formed within the classroom is unparalleled to anything else.", "[0.75] [Winter 2022] Excellent course.  Necessary to take to support the challenges of academics and career", "[1.0] [Winter 2022] Please take it! Diane is not only a mentor, but a true friend and companion. I'm so grateful to have someone like her in my life, and am so grateful that she took the time to teach the course.

I learned so much and am so grateful for the community I formed in the class during my time.", "[0.7] [Winter 2022] A great class for connecting with other people and building community. If you are feeling lost in life this class will help you figure out which directions to go in.", "[0.55] [Winter 2022] It's a lot more work than you're probably anticipating it will be, and not always worth it?

The skills and ideas that I learned will serve me for a long time. In this class you'll learn what you value, your strengths, what energizes you as well as tools for positivity and mindfulness, as well as finding purpose. The group became close in part due to small group time and also sharing during full class sessions. Diane Friedlaender is a fabulous and kind teacher with deep knowledge about purpose and flourishing. I loved the readings, videos and poems, and the exercises in class were meaningful and often fun. I believe everyone should take a class like this one while at Stanford.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] It's a great experience! Diane is an amazing and caring person who helps students take whatever they need from the course.", "[0.5] [Winter 2022] There is not a person I would not recommend this course for. It helped me so, so much with finding my sense of identity and purpose in a place like Stanford. Talking with the DCI fellows gave me a perspective on my Stanford experience that I truly could not anywhere else.", "[-0.3] [Winter 2022] I could not recommend this class more", "[0.7] [Winter 2022] This is a very worthwhile course as a counterbalance to what can be a grind at Stanford.  I think all students would benefit from having these tools as part of the educational experience and preparation for life after Stanford.", "[0.4] [Winter 2022] If you are interested in investing in yourself, take this course.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] If you're looking for a course to help you recharge and act as a break from the normal hustle and bustle of campus life, this is a fantastic course to take! The instruction is great and a course like this really helps foster a sense of community. This course helped me gain a greater understanding of my Stanford experience.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2021] Highly recommend, the combination of the workbook and excellent instruction provides enormous insight into oneself and ones place in the world.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2021] It is very worthwhile class to take especially following covid and the isolation.  the small group discussions were wonderful and enriching", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] Please take this class! I was a beautiful course that allowed you to reflect and learn more about yourself in a safe and open environment. Everyone should take this class while they're an undergraduate.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] This course is great, especially for seniors! It's a great way to get units and have time to think about how you're going to spend life after college.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] This is a really fantastic course that will give you the time and space to take a hard look at your life and mentality and see what you would like to improve on or change.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] I would highly recommend this class to any student considering it. Because I am limited in my understanding of upperclassmen experiences, I can say with confidence freshmen would greatly benefit by learning a bit more about themselves and developing a community. I genuinely find myself practicing meditation and appreciating the wonderful people in my life, and it's these small things that have made me much happier as a person.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] This course is really great! Even if you don't leave with a firm and sure purpose on what your purpose is, you will have at least spent time each week reflecting on who you are, how you treat yourself, how you treat others, and that's still something. Also, Diane is incredibly kind and not too strict about deadlines for each of the assignments.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] This is an introductory course to living a purposeful life. Course workbook was beautiful and fun to write in but the readings were a bit dry and didn't resonate with me. Would recommend if you haven't engaged in introspection because it provides a structured space to to do, but if you already have a solid self-reflection practice, you might not gain a lot from this course. Make sure you are willing to commit to the various activities because this is definitely a course where you get out what you put in.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2021] This class can be incredibly useful for students who are looking for a framework to define purpose. But it's not for everybody. I'd encourage anybody who is considering taking it to look closely at the workbook at the outset of the term, as a kind of gauge as to whether that's the type of thing you're looking for.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] Every class allowed me to learn about more topics in wellness.  The assignments gave me the opportunity to carve out time for these important opportunities.  It is a good use of time and gives some respite from the harried pace of the usual academic classes.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] If internal balancing - of mind, heart - and calibrating toward purpose and process and away from product/production this is an excellent class. The more you participate individually and as a member of the class with others in the class the more you will benefit and grow. There are resources here that will be useful for years to come.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] I loved this course, it came for me at a very pivotal time in my Stanford career. If you are wanting to know more about your purpose, feel a bit aimless, and want have a dedicated space to inquire about whats important to you and how you can outwardly apply it, take this course. Yes, there are some readings and a final project that some may find not necessary, but its barely any time and you can choose to make the project beneficial to your personal quarter. People do things as complicated as public art pieces and as simple as going outside more. Take the class, Diane is awesome!", "[0.0] [Autumn 2021] Every student should think about this topic before they graduate from Stanford.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] This class is a really nice way to give yourself time to be reflective. The professor is really kind, encouraging and down to earth. I really enjoyed building a community with the class and it is a great break from the rest of Stanford life.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2021] Go into it with an open mind", "[-0.85] [Spring 2021] If you are still discovering yourself, and are seeking to learn about yourself and your mental health this is the class for you. If you are person who is mentally healthy and who is looking for their purpose in this world this is absolutely not the class for you. This class deals alot with analyzing your inner strengths, qualities weaknesses, etc while spending little next to no time on analyzing things in the world that might give you purpose of excite you. Being the latter type of person, I found this class to be time wasting and annoying, especially since the work for the class is annoyingly timed. While you have relatively little work, the way our class was designed the assignments that did have a good deal of work and time were always assigned right during midterm and finals weeks which is seriously annoyingly. Also since the class is not super well organized the work is not well dispersed within this time, and I found myself always annoyed that I had to devote time to a project I didn't care for, right during midterm or finals when I was crazy busy.", "[-0.6] [Spring 2021] Take this class!!! It really helped me stay balanced during the spring quarter and during tough mental obstacles.", "[0.8] [Spring 2021] Great class, really worthwhile for figuring your life out", "[0.85] [Spring 2021] If done right, this course can teach you to embrace living every day with purpose. I think you'll get the most out of it if you're really present during the 2-hour classes, and if you at least skim the readings. Here and there, truly interesting insights come through from the readings or the activities in class. And I can definitely say that I'm going to change how I live my life as a result of this course.", "[0.6] [Spring 2021] Great course and relatively light workload", "[0.6] [Spring 2021] This course allows you to deeply reflect on yourself, something that not a lot of classes make you do and something that can be quite uncomfortable at first. If you just take the dive into it though, you will be greatly awarded with an amazing experience.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] Take it! The syllabus makes it seem like a lot more work than it really is- Sarah is amazing and is very lenient when it comes to grading! With each assignment she offers personalized feedback which is something you don't get in a lot of Stanford courses. I would also recommend starting on your Purpose Project early, not because it's a lot of work but because it might just be annoying to do later on when you have a bunch of stressful finals. You want to enjoy the Purpose Project process, so plan accordingly. I love wellness courses and recommend every Stanford student takes at least one each year!", "[0.7] [Spring 2021] Take it! Sarah is awesome and it is a great change of pace from the rigor of other classes and it gives you space to really reflect and think about what it means to live on purpose. Not much work at all and a few short papers under 5 pages that are low stress and mainly reflective.", "[0.6] [Spring 2021] This is an introspective course that is a great break from other academic courses and utilizes a lot of reflection and action projects", "[0.9] [Winter 2021] A great opportunity to introspect and get to know yourself better!", "[0.85] [Winter 2021] tbh there were a ton of readings and a pair of essays and a project. for a wellness class i got a lot of stress out of it. just made me enjoy my life even less, and i started the quarter pretty unhappy. Learned good things about mental health, will keep looking for small classes where I can learn mental health stuff.  a one/two unit on mental health should really not add assignments, come on. I would have like more presentation of material and less readings.", "[0.0] [Winter 2021] You get out what you put in.", "[0.45] [Winter 2021] Definitely take this course!", "[1.0] [Winter 2021] If you're not willing to open your heart to a course this isn't gonna work for you.  As someone who sometimes has trouble letting myself be \"soft\", whatever I even mean by that, this class could be a stretch sometimes.  But whenever I really let it wash over me instead of acting like I was too cool for \"loving kindness meditation\" or whatever, I got a whole lot out of it and really enjoyed it.  If you want to reflect in a structured and interesting manner - take this class.", "[0.9] [Winter 2021] This class provides a great opportunity for self exploration. The students and teaching team created a very safe learning environment that allows you to be vulnerable which makes for great discussions. The amount of projects may seem a bit overwhelming for a small unit class but the teaching team is very supportive.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] I think this is a great class to take if you are looking to slow down and reflect and find yourself. It was a really safe space to just slow down and talk to people who are incredibly smart and from such different backgrounds and talk about fulfillment and happiness and making a difference.", "[1.0] [Winter 2021] This class is really very helpful! I'd highly recommended it to people who are interested in taking it. I feel like i've gained really useful tools thanks to this class to improve my overall wellness, I also feel more connected to and engaged with people having similar issues. This class has been such a fruitful experience for me.", "[0.75] [Winter 2021] Definitely take it and be honest with yourself, that\u2019s how you\u2019ll get the most out of it !", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] Great course to take if you are genuinely interested in learning more about yourself, your values, and your goals for the future. In a small class setting, the more you share vulnerably, the more you will connect with your classmates. Diane was very supportive and truly cared about her students.", "[0.65] [Winter 2021] I loved the teaching team! Participating in discussions and doing all the readings/assignments is how you get the most out of the course.", "[0.9] [Winter 2021] More work than I expected for a 2-unit course. Weekly readings weren't too difficult (or required), but the over-arching course passion project, final podcast, and pair of reflection papers surprised me. Would recommend to anyone seriously interested in introspection and purpose finding, but not as a layup for units.", "[0.8] [Winter 2021] Very engaging, class meetings are the best aspect of this class.", "[0.6] [Spring 2020] Great choice", "[0.0] [Spring 2020] take it! it will change the way that you approach every day", "[0.65] [Spring 2019] Wonderful teachers and class!

The workbook is great for organizing thoughts and a life long resource.", "[0.0] [Spring 2019] Take the class!", "[0.85] [Spring 2019] lots of good opportunities of self reflection. It is what you make it, so a better course to take if you have time to commit.", "[0.5] [Spring 2019] Especially for this class, you get out what you put in. The end of the class was really moving and powerful because everyone really brought themselves to the questions and the work. If you aren't ready to be vulnerable and honest, this maybe isn't the class for you.", "[0.35] [Spring 2019] I recommend it", "[0.7] [Winter 2019] You get out what you put in. If you just attend class without doing anything then this class will feel like a waste of time. However, if you put in the work then this class will be extremely beneficial. This is because this class is designed to help the students find their purposes. You have to do bulk of the work yourself.", "[-0.4] [Winter 2019] lame", "[0.2] [Winter 2019] I highly recommend this class so you can think about your Stanford journey as a whole or even your life. Arguably more practical than an academic class.", "[0.0] [Winter 2019] This class won't tell you your purpose in life, but will equip you with tools to continually figure it out for yourself.", "[0.0] [Winter 2019] Take it!", "[0.85] [Winter 2019] Aneel Chima is an excellent instructor.  He knows what he's talking about to a very deep level, and has provided me and many others immensely valuable life advice.  Highly recommend this course and any course by him.", "[0.3] [Winter 2019] It's ok", "[0.7] [Spring 2018] Take it! It opens up many interesting conversations about what brings you, and others, purpose. It can't hurt to spend a few hours each week thinking about this!", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] The course is a fantastic resource for self-reflection and self-learning. Perhaps more than anything else, taking the course was valuable to me because it provided me with new frames of mind to better understand what I find truly important and how to better live my life so that my actions reflect what I value.", "[0.75] [Spring 2018] Take this course if you want to start a VERY insightful journey! I approach the world, myself, and my relationships with other completely differently (I'd say much better) than I did in the past. Would recommend!", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] Probably one of the most rewarding courses I've ever taken here at Stanford -- especially because it's quite different from most other classes. Highly encourage anyone to take it. Dustin and Aneel are very friendly and easy to communicate with.", "[0.2] [Spring 2018] Take it!

The teachers are very interesting and will challenge your beliefs about purpose.", "[0.0] [Winter 2018] Its really dense, not very happy-go-lucky", "[0.75] [Winter 2018] I didn't find this class particularly engaging or useful, but I could definitely see how it could be to people.

In a similar light, it helps a lot to add 1 or 2 points to your final \"health span plan\" from each lecture, so your final plan is more-or-less complete with ideas from all course topics by the end of the quarter.", "[0.8] [Winter 2022] It's a good one, Dr Molly is great", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] You get out of this course what you put in. Dr. Molly is awesome, and the class provides a ton of useful information, but it is relatively unstructured so you have to be motivated to want to learn the material.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] such an incredible class. after studying china at stanford for 4 years, it wasn't until this class that I actually felt as if I understand china's recent economic history--particularly rural china. I dont think that you can understand modern china without having taken this class. Such a wonderful curriculum, and professor oi is truly incredible--one of the best professors I've ever had. the midterm and final are definitely tough, but if you do the readings and stay engaged, you will do well.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] Molly is an amazing person, and the lessons from this class will probably be the most important health advice you'll get in your life! instruction could be improved and be made more interactive, it's very lecture-heavy. But good class!", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] absolutely take it! Dr. Molly was so amazing and inspiring, and if you passionate about self-care and health, your horizons will be expanded so much by this class", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Molly is a very busy person and therefore did not have too much time to spend on the class, but she's really knowledgable and passionate about the subject. She's an excellent lecturer and her class inspires students to change their life for the better.", "[0.2] [Winter 2022] This is a good course although it is not always evidence based. A good portion of what Dr. Molly teaches is anecdotal (which she recognizes) and/or drawn from the \"functional medicine\" community rather than the evidence based scientific medical community. If you're interested in \"biohacking\" or \"functional medicine\" this is a good course for you, although I personally feel like these narratives do a disservice overall, often bordering on the line of misinformation. The claims that people like Jason Fung and Mark Hyman make are largely not supported by the literature/evidence based community, and any literature that does support their claims is typically flawed. Molly falls into this group of functional medicine doctors. She perpetuates a number of myths throughout her course and potentially misinforms naive students looking to improve their health. While I do think that overall what she teaches is most likely a net-positive, you have to go into it being skeptical and not accepting everything she says as verbatim. Requires you to do your own research which can often be difficult and lead to more misinformation. TLDR; functional medicine is BS imo. If it's something you believe in and are into, take this course, otherwise I wouldn't recommend it. Course title and description may be somewhat misleading.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Dr. Molly is an awesome person with so many great insights into health and life overall. This class is a bit lecture heavy, but I would definitely recommend.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Molly Maloof is a caring and amazing instructor. This course is extremely useful for life.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] This is an amazing class if you are at all interested in public service, I highly recommend it and you will meet amazing people, instructors, and guest speakers.", "[0.7] [Winter 2022] Amazing course, if you have the chance to take this class, do it.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] This course is essential and should be required. It will change your life, and in no way is that an exaggeration. No matter what you want to do, if you want to be happy, successful, or for literally anything that you want to do in your life, this is foundational. Dr. Molly is an amazing teacher. She's incredibly engaged and goes above and beyond. Get everything you can out of this course and share it with your friends. You'll love it.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2020] I would absolutely recommend it! As I have said, Stanford teaches students how to be great in their field of study, but rarely do you find such eye-opening classes like this one, that teach you how to understand your body and mind and use that to benefit not only your health but productivity and efficiency in your other work. It would be amazing if this was part of the \"liberal education\" that Stanford is giving us. A must take!!!", "[0.6] [Autumn 2020] It's a great course for learning how to manage stress and live a healthy life as a student.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] This is a really really awesome course. You can tell that Molly teaches from the heart and is doing this because she cares about helping people and giving back. She is a true gem and you will learn a TON of stuff that otherwise would be completely overlooked in your educations.", "[0.4] [Autumn 2020] This is a life-changing course. The insights, tools, and action-items you will take away from this class have the potential of dramatically improving the quality of your life, and of those around you. A must do when you are Stanford.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2020] I think that EVERYONE can benefit from this class in one way or another! You become more self-aware of your bad habits, you learn why these bad habits are actually bad (the science behind it) which motivated me to actually fix many of my bad habits, and you learn practical ways to improve your health. I feel so much happier and so much more balanced after having taking this class. Also, Molly is super supportive and friendly!", "[1.0] [Autumn 2020] This course was AWESOME! Dr. Molly Maloof is a fantastic (caring and funny) teacher. I cannot explain how much she has taught and helped me open up and change my life in a positive way! The amount of efforts and resources Dr. Molly Maloof puts forward is amazing! This course was very interesting and interactive, and because I am so passionate about human health, I was always excited for all of her lessons and assignments. I highly recommend that you are open to how different aspects affect different bodily systems and improving your own lifestyle in this class--if you do not want to improve your own mental and physical health, this class may be a little daunting for you.", "[0.85] [Spring 2019] molly is very knowledgable and is passionate about teaching health and fitness to students! take this course if you are interesting in any aspect of health - we even learned how to properly floss together!", "[0.65] [Spring 2019] Please, take it! You'll learn so much and it will change your life for the better.", "[0.75] [Spring 2019] really useful class. definitely take it", "[-0.25] [Spring 2019] Go to all the seminars because you will learn a lot in class. Little or no homework.", "[0.9] [Spring 2019] Take it. Dr. Molly is extremely knowledgeable and kind and she really just wants to help people with everything she's learned. Her lectures are engaging and the information from this course is very valuable.", "[0.7] [Spring 2019] TAKE IT!!! Molly is great", "[0.9] [Spring 2019] Wanna revamp your life? Take this course!!! I learned so much information on health that is actually helpful and that you can actually do!! The actionable part of this course was really great!!!! TAKE IT!! Also Dr. Molly IS A BADASS!!!", "[1.0] [Spring 2019] TAKE IT!!! It is by far the best class  that I have taken at Stanford. Dr. Molly is so cool and amazing and I want to be her! She found a way to make indigestible medical articles understandable and applicable to our daily lives. More importantly, her positive and go-getter attitude towards health was infectious, and she made me feel genuinely excited about health and motivated to make improvements to my own. I actually looked forward to her lectures every Wednesday. I really hope Dr. Molly starts her own podcast, because I didn't want her lectures to end!! It was an amazing class!!", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] TAKE IT! it is AWESOME. very low commitment but the payoff is enormous. Dr. Molly is amazing and so knowledgeable and is incredibly dedicated to her work. By far one of my favorite classes at Stanford. You will leave healthier and more confident in taking control of your health", "[0.2] [Spring 2019] Really worth taking! Nothing is as important as health."], "WELLNESS 127": ["[0.75] [Autumn 2022] Super interesting and applicable. Changed the way I see food and fueling.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2022] This is a great way to learn about how to better your life through nutrition", "[0.75] [Autumn 2022] A lot of information all at once, often seemingly irrelevant and redundant, as it is quite technical. If you are able to filter this out, you walk away with a lot of useful advice on things you can change to optimize your life.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] Great course and fascinating materials. I am much more aware of my overall health or metabolism after the course, and have gained many ideas to improve that. Work load is a bit high though...", "[0.45] [Autumn 2022] useful", "[-0.2] [Autumn 2022] Wouldn't recommend this class. The lectures feels very repetitive towards the latter half of the quarter and the professor goes through research at a high speed without explaining them well. This is the class with least takeaway for me. Also, I am surprised that there's no sense of community at all in this 15-people class. The classroom setup is no different from viewing youtube lectures on the same materials, which, to be honest, would probably be more informative and engaging.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is curious about metabolism. Dr. Wilson is extremely knowledgeable, a great and passionate teacher, and I believe you would be hard-pressed to find better instruction on this topic anywhere else.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2022] n/a", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] Great course, learned a lot, definitely take advantage of the great prof as he is super willing to help you!", "[0.6] [Autumn 2022] Very good course and homework and journalling are designed to allow you to  get actionable ideas about how to incorporate learnings from the course into your individual lifestyle. \n\nBit heavy on the biochemistry if you don't have that background.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2021] I highly recommend this class! I learned so much about how the body works and what it needs. Clyde Wilson throws a ton of information at you, but he's very clear that you should take what works for you and forget the rest. I've already implemented knowledge from this class into my life and I talk about the material from this class all the time. Take it!", "[1.0] [Autumn 2021] This is a great, very information dense class, but presented in a way where you're encouraged to take only the most personally important and useful aspects to you from what is discussed in lecture to apply to your own life. Dr. Wilson is a very enthusiastic and passionate professor! I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning more about metabolism.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] This course was incredibly cool and insightful. It is a low stress course as you are primarily graded on participation and engagement but still offers an incredibly deep dive into what makes your body work and how you can optimize your life through different healthy habits.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] super interesting material!", "[0.75] [Autumn 2021] Very fast-paced but packed with great info", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] It is really cool if you are an athlete or are curious about how to improve your wellness. It is an interesting class and you might just discover that some of your habits are not beneficial to your health and what is pushed out as 'healthy living' in the media can be common misconceptions.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] Awesome class. Clyde is super knowledgeable about metabolism.", "[-0.15] [Autumn 2021] It's a very hard course for 1 unit, and does have a lot of work. But you learn a ton!", "[1.0] [Autumn 2021] Really interesting class! You learn a lot about the science behind metabolism and all the different variables that affect it, all while creating a personalized approach to optimizing your own metabolism. Prof. Wilson really emphasizes staying true to yourself and the things you enjoy as you think about interventions you can make to improve your metabolism, which is really nice - a huge contrast to much of diet culture. I definitely recommend!", "[0.85] [Spring 2021] Good course that goes much deeper into metabolism -- nutrition, movement, sleep, stress -- than other wellness courses I've taken. It doesn't stop at macros or micronutrients and instead talks about really interesting research that is quite eye-opening. Clyde could ramble a bit sometimes though, which made lectures over Zoom a bit draining. There was also quite a lot of work -- about 10 assignments total and each was about 5 pages. Some of them were helpful, but others just felt a bit too repetitive or too abstract to be helpful for my daily metabolism goals. Got a few points that I really took away from the course though, which I thought was worthwhile.", "[0.5] [Spring 2021] This an incredible course. Clyde really cares about the material and that is what makes it impactful. It really applies to anyone, even though who are training for the Olympics. Also note this is more work than most 1 unit courses - expect maybe 2 units of workload.", "[0.8] [Spring 2021] A great course to learn about metabolism and get a piece of practical advice on how to improve it!", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] This is a super interesting course if you're wanting to learn how to speed up your metabolism! If you don't have a science background, some of the readings may be a bit hard to follow, but Prof. Wilson does a good job giving general overviews and practical applications in lecture. Make sure you allocate enough time to finish the journals and homework.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] Highly valuable! So applicable and very high impact! Super grateful to the instructor for creating such a valuable course and truly centering meaningful learning.", "[0.65] [Spring 2021] I would tell them to 100% take it - it's a fantastic course and they will be able to implement things from the class that will make them feel better and be healthier right away. Can't recommend highly enough.", "[0.8] [Spring 2021] This is an amazing course where you where learn everything you'd imagine to plus more! You will learn lessons that you will carry with you and tell everyone you know. But be warned this class is a fair amount of work and although it is one unit it is really more like a 2 unit or 3 unit course.", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] really interesting. the prof is clearly passionate and knowledgable and makes this a really interesting experience", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] great course. funny and interesting professor. very passionate about what he teaches so lectures are very interesting and interactive too. definitely helped reshape the way I look at food, nutrition, and health in general. recommend to everyone!", "[0.55] [Autumn 2019] Take it!

Clyde has amazing expertise and passion for human health", "[0.6] [Autumn 2019] There is a lot of information packed into this course, but it is extremely interesting.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2019] interesting and potentially helpful course", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Interesting course, Dr Wilson is clearly extremely knowledgeable about the subject and is an engaging personality. I have to admit I would often zone out during the heavier chemistry-focused parts of the class. But Dr. Wilson clearly cares a lot about the quality of the class, and I don't doubt that it'll improve in the next iteration.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2019] Take it", "[0.7] [Autumn 2019] Very interesting, fast paced, need to stay engaged if you want to take something away", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] It's interesting and worth it if you're an athlete or someone else looking to optimize their bodies.

Take it if you're experienced or new! Sarah knows the material very well and the teaching was great.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] The course was really good in covering the different types of meditation and giving us a week to practice them. The retreat class at the end was a pleasure to attend. However, it is heavier in some aspects than a typical 1 unit course as the scholarly reflections are due every other week and it needs some reading to be done. Other than than its great.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] I'd highly recommend this course for anyone interested in meditation and incorporating mindfulness into your daily life. You definitely get out of this class what you put in, so be prepared to dedicate time and energy into practicing every day. Given the time necessary for meditation practice and assignments, I would say that this is more work than a typical one unit, so only take it if you have the capacity!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] Great class! Honestly at first I was not expecting the biweekly (every other week) 2-page writing assignments and readings...I kinda fell behind on that but Sarah was nice enough to let me catch up over break. She is super wonderful and cares a lot about her students. I think one page might be more reasonable just because having that extra assignment added more stress to my week than before (which is kind of counterintuitive) but overall I learned a lot.", "[-0.65] [Autumn 2022] This course helped to lower my stress levels and helped me to be more aware of when I'm being too hard on myself.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] This class it amazing and a perfect introduction to the world of mediation and mindfulness. Sarah creates a safe space for each students growth into this class and is great at interweaving the spiritual and scientific sides of the subject. There is only one class per week, with bi-weekly journal entries, and lots of extra resources.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2022] Go for it, it's a refreshing class to take amidst a hectic quarter", "[0.5] [Autumn 2022] Very well-organised class. I enjoyed my quarter more overall because of my consistent meditation practice through the class.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2022] Please take this course if you are curious about meditation. The instructor is amazing, to say the least.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2022] Take this class! It helped me feel more grounded throughout the quarter and helped me develop my own meditation schedule.", "[0.4] [Autumn 2022] Please meditate!", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] I loved Wellness 130. Sarah manages to approach the subject of mindfulness with the perfect blend of science and feeling, and she establishes herself quickly as an authority and as someone you truly can trust. This course is a function of what you hope to achieve; there are assignments, but they are not taxing if you are even sem-serious about enriching your life and your ability to get through the day more smoothly. I would totally recommend it.", "[0.4] [Winter 2022] This is a tremendous course to introduce you to meditation and mindfulness. This was my first time taking such a course, and I really felt like I got a lot out of it. The things you learn really stick with you.", "[0.8] [Winter 2022] This has been one of my favorite classes at Stanford! Just take it!! Especially if you struggle with taking time for yourself. At least you<U+02BB>ll get a credit for #selfcare :)", "[0.75] [Winter 2022] Great meditation class, but try to take it when it is completely in-person. There is a limit to how effective the class is on a virtual setting + it is much harder to build community", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] I would highly recommend this class to any students who want to start learning meditation, or improve their practice! Sarah is a great teacher and teaches techniques that make things make a lot more sense especially with how they are portrayed in popular culture. I have done this class for two quarters and the class discussions and community that is developed has been amazing both times. I am very grateful that I got the opportunity to take this class.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Take it! I used to dread the 1 page reflections, but they really only take like 15 minutes and I ended up realizing that they are a super helpful way to reflect on your experiences.", "[-0.15] [Winter 2022] This is a very useful class.

I took this course to get better at meditation but I don't think I built a meditation habit or improved. This course is a survey of meditation, so if there is one type of meditation you like you will only spend a week on it. What I did learn a ton about and am incredibly grateful for is mindfulness. I was very skeptical about mindfulness before this course but am incredibly grateful to have learned about the science and practice of mindfulness. The book we read in this class is amazing.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] This is a wonderful course. I would highly recommend it to every single Stanford student. We all deserve a moment to reflect, breathe, and be at peace in our hectic schedules. It is minimal workload and so enjoyable. Take it, take it, take it!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] I really liked this class! The two writing assignments were not a big deal. Aneel is a fantastic speaker, and I liked listening to him a lot", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Take this class with Aneel. This course is amazing if you are interested in and willing to give everything a try. You will get out of the class what you put in. If you decide to slack off, only attend the one in person class a week, and not do the meditations you will get very little, but if you really listen to Aneel and give meditation a genuine try, you will LOVE this class.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] I would highly recommend this course. Professor Aneel is a great instructor and will help in building a solid foundation about meditation.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Although I took this course during a light quarter, I suspect it could be an especially helpful respite during a busy quarter. It's the sort of course where you get out what you put in-- the amount of work that actually gets submitted is very light (just two short reflection papers, in the quarter when I took it), but students are expected to do readings, meditation practice, and a self-guided retreat outside of class for their own benefit. Dr. Chima is also a wonderful instructor who clearly cares deeply about his students. It was a class I looked forward to every week, so if you get the chance, take it!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] Wonderful course with great instruction", "[0.65] [Autumn 2021] Definitely take it! You won't regret it.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2021] To make the most of the class you have to make time for it. Aneel is great a lot of the things discussed in class about meditation apply really well to life as whole", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Course definitely is cool if you are interested in beginning a regular meditation practice but if you have some background you could likely devote less time to achieve the same results.

Aneel is an amazing instructor!", "[0.5] [Autumn 2021] Incredible course to reset, refresh, and refocus.

It's amazing for connecting with yourself and others, and I would highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.", "[-0.05] [Autumn 2021] Leave your expectations for what meditation/ what a meditation class is at thr door.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2021] This class is relaxing and enjoyable with not much work.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] A really transformative class. You get out of it what you put in. The best part was being able to meet and talk to other people interested in practicing mindfulness and meditation", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Take this course! Everyone can benefit so greatly from introducing mindfulness meditation into their lives, and Sarah is such a lovely woman who fosters such a safe and welcoming space.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2021] You get out what you put in. If you put the effort in, you will learn and gain so much.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Highly recommend for beginners of meditation who want to learn both practical and scientific side of meditation. I think I know myself better after this meditation, and it brought me a lot of peace and positivity as well.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2021] I would recommend if you find yourself very stressed all the time, lingering on your past or future, or feel like you're just going through the motions. It really helps you look at the world through a different lens.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Great course! Sarah is an exceptional, thoughtful and inspiring teacher who cares deeply about every single individual in the class.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2021] I loved this class, Sarah is a great teacher and very kind. It is both a great introduction to meditation AND a great way to enhance a already existing meditation practice. I learned a lot both from Sarah and the wonderful class community she fostered. The class readings can be either hit or miss for people, but otherwise I loved it and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in meditation.", "[-0.35] [Autumn 2021] Could not recommend more highly!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] I would recommend this course to anyone who asked. Dr. Tapia Meyers is an amazing instructor, and I was surprised at how much this course helped support my well being and transition this quarter as a first year master's student. I really loved the supplemental readings and materials, and will be enrolling in wellness courses every quarter I can here at Stanford.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] It's a VERY good class. The work isn't crazy and what little work you do get is very beneficial to yourself. It's a class that I would definitely recommend especially because in such a high stress environment as this it can be easy to lose ourselves in our work while not really being aware of what our bodies are telling us. This class teaches you how to monitor that and not give in to the stress through self compassion and self kindness. I came in with a healthy amount of skepticism but I don't at all regret taking the class.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] LOVE THIS CLASS!! Please take this if you care about your well-being at all. Not only is this a great way to break up your week, but it was actually really powerful and moving at the end when we all shared our takeaways. This was one of the things I most looked forward to every week. I will definitely be repeating this at some point in my Stanford career.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2021] TAKE THIS COURSE!! TAKE THIS COURSE!! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!! TAKE IT! TAKE IT!", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] Take this class if you have any interest in meditation! I promise you will grow your practice. And the community of fellow meditators you will be a part of is so wholesome and supportive.", "[0.95] [Summer 2021] Take it take it take it! It was so transformative for me, the things you learn not only applies to meditation but LIFE in general. You will find people in class who are also looking for inner peace, who are dealing with stress and anxiety, and people who want to experience this world in a more mindful way. Aneel is a great instructor, his guided meditations make me learn so much, and he is just a great person in general. It's just 1 unit and there is no stress at all.", "[0.7] [Summer 2021] I really recommend this course if you are at all interested in meditation and want to see what it's all about.", "[0.75] [Summer 2021] the best class i've taken at Stanford. You need this class. You need it. And as an engineer who was skeptical about \"meditation\" in the first place I can't imagine my life right now if I hadn't. My life is so much better because of this class. How many people can say that about a course? take it.", "[0.4] [Summer 2021] Meditation improves my life.", "[0.9] [Summer 2021] This course is a breath of fresh air. Aneel is genuinely concerned with your well-being as a student and human. The material is brilliant and feels more like a privilege than an assignment.", "[0.55] [Summer 2021] This course is worth taking if you are interested in learning about how to meditate. You get out of it what you put into it.", "[0.8] [Summer 2021] You should take it, its such a refreshing and joyful class. Professor Aneel is the most caring and genuine professor I have ever had.", "[0.9] [Summer 2021] I would highly recommend taking this course! Wellness 130 was completely different than any other course I have taken at Stanford. While there is homework, papers, and a final project, the goal of the class was not assessment, but actual self improvement. The instructor Aneel wanted nothing more, and I really enjoyed having him as my teacher.", "[0.75] [Summer 2021] This is a super helpful class for anyone no matter where you are in your meditation journey.", "[0.8] [Summer 2021] great professor and fun class. to more effort you put in the more youll get out of the class", "[0.9] [Summer 2021] I HIGHLY recommend that everyone take this course, even if you've taken a meditation course before. Aneel presents ideas in an accessible, engaging way, and fosters a really wonderful space for everyone to grow, regardless of how much experience you've had with a meditative practice in the past. I thought I knew what meditation was, but this course totally re-shaped my understanding and set me up for success as I seek to integrate my practice into my life moving forward.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] Professor Tapia is so passionate about meditation and is always prone to show us its importance as well as the positive effects it has on us as busy humans at Stanford. i think this class allows you to take a step back, disconnect from the harsh routine and the overload of work to better understand who you are and what you need in certain moments. Amazing class!", "[0.35] [Spring 2021] This is a serious course, and a very worthwhile and life-improving course at that", "[0.8] [Spring 2021] Great class would highly recommend.

The content and space provided in this course is amazing.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] I loved this course. One of my favorites since I began at Stanford. Sarah is an incredibly supportive professor who works hard to get to know all of her students on a personal level in an effort to better encourage their growth. This class has sparked a new interest in bettering myself that I hope I will bring with me throughout the rest of my life.", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] I would definitely recommend this class to everyone I know. Sarah is an amazingly kind and understanding instructor.

Aneel is amazing.", "[0.4] [Winter 2021] A fantastic course! In the winter '21 iteration there seemed to be not as much of an emphasis on meditation practices and more of an emphasis on mindfulness applied to life, but this turned out to be exactly what I needed.", "[0.9] [Winter 2021] I came into this course having only dabbled in meditation, and I learned a lot from it! I don't feel like a meditation \"expert,\" but I gained a lot of tools to use in my meditation practice. This course provided me good structure for holding me accountable for my practice, and there were ample opportunities for reflection (alone and with others). Be prepared to spend ~1-2 hours/week outside of class periods (making space for meditation and formal reflections).", "[0.7] [Winter 2021] The course is very helpful to maintain mindfulness during a stressful quarter. The assigned reading is very transformative as well, so I encourage reading it.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] Take it! Professor is great and the classes are super useful and engaging. And you learn a ton about this field.", "[0.7] [Winter 2021] It's a bit more work than you expect for a 1 unit class, but it's quite rewarding.", "[0.5] [Winter 2021] This is the closest I've came to witnessing cultural expropriation first hand.", "[0.65] [Winter 2021] Good class, would recommend", "[-0.1] [Winter 2021] It really helped with bringing my stress levels down during the pandemic. I feel like I have a lot more time now.", "[0.9] [Winter 2021] really cool class to take to take a step back and pause and be in the moment. Aneel is a great teacher and does an awesome job of guiding, teaching, and accepting", "[0.6] [Winter 2021] While in the class, I started meditating every day. I found the readings in the class to be very compelling and it was helpful connecting with other students and hearing advice in class.", "[0.8] [Winter 2021] I'm very glad I took this course. I have always wanted to learn how to meditate but didn't know where to start.

Aneel creates an an engaging and supportive class experience.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2020] The remote version of the class does the best it can, but what you get from it will depend entirely on your own commitment! An in-person version would hold you more accountable to the practice", "[0.9] [Autumn 2020] I really enjoyed this course. It was a much needed class for this rollercoaster of a year. It helped me through the quarter and helped me build the tools to feel much calmer, focused, and overall happy throughout the quarter and even after.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] I found meditation to be useful both as a student and as a person. With particular breathing and body scan meditations, I learned how to manage tension in my body/mind that arise while studying, or from stress, and this helped me stay mindfully focused and manage a large workload as a student. Meditation taught me a new type of learning whereby we are surprisingly receptive to new perceptions and insights by practicing a still mind. When this technique is coupled with an intention to grow and do good, this is powerful. I personally feel that meditation, if practiced in a context of kindness and compassion, allows us to expand an inner world with positive desires for ourselves and the world, that will inevitably manifest in external growth.", "[0.2] [Autumn 2020] It is very practical and valuable in the social and mental sense to a student in a competitive and stressful environment", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] Best course I've taken at Stanford. If you're just looking for an easy 1 unit course with minimal effort, this certainly fits the bill. But if you put in the effort and really engage with the meditations, readings, and the discussions (which isn't much work anyway), there's a lot of self-insight to be had. The course actually worked pretty well over zoom, doing meditations in your room/bed wearing sweats was a plus.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2020] Although the class meetings are relatively low-information-density, the reading and the out-of-class exercises are really great. I found myself skeptical of the class' value at the beginning, but by the end, through the accumulation of practice and exposure (and the assistance of a regular check-in in class for creating a new habit), I can say that I have a totally new outlook on meditation and am truly excited to maintain this new habit.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2020] The readings were extremely helpful and rewarding.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] Definitely take this course! The resources provided are amazing and so helpful and the professor really creates an inclusive and warm class-environment (even virtually).

Very useful and practical. I had tried to learn to meditate before but I really needed the accountability that this class provided. Sarah is a great instructor and very knowledgeable.", "[-0.95] [Spring 2020] Undisputedly the worst 1-unit class I've ever taken at Stanford. Perhaps others won't say it out of politeness, but I'll tell you this: for a 1-unit class, you have to write 1-2 pages of \"scholarly reflection\" every week, which must incorporate material from not just your experience, but also a book you need to buy (and read 3 chapters a week), and \"at least one scholarly article posted.\" Otherwise, you face petty deductions and may not even pass the class. Distastefully and unnecessarily pedantic for a 1-unit wellness class.  The instructor can't stop emphasizing her qualifications and how much research has been done on meditation, as if to prove a point to you rather than to help you. In a time of uncertainty and worry, she sends out multiple page-long announcements every week reminding you your reflections \"need to be scholarly\", you have to read the book and the papers she posted, and you have to meet her 1-on-1.  Ironically, the work for this meditation class seem to bring stress and frustration. You can avoid all that unhappiness, the book fee, and the $35 course fee, by finding videos online, attending other meditation sessions at Stanford, or using an app.", "[0.7] [Spring 2020] Very helpful, especially for Stanford students.

It convinced me to finally start, and I feel my life will be forever changed.", "[0.4] [Autumn 2019] you don't need any experience so i would highly recommend", "[0.45] [Autumn 2019] I highly recommend!", "[0.75] [Autumn 2019] Absolutely take it! Sarah is great. The class will provide a survey through direct practice of the many different types of meditation.

Would recommend.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2019] Really simple: are you interested in learning how to meditate? Great, for one hour a week you get one credit and some exposure to meditation.

I always enjoyed going to class and definitely grew as a meditator over the past 10 weeks.", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] It's a great class if you are considering learning meditation in a more systematical way. It will also provide in-class mediation so you can discuss your  questions right after it. Strongly recommended.", "[0.7] [Winter 2019] I was a relaxing course. I would recommend it if you have space in your calendar", "[-0.2] [Winter 2019] Just take this course. Seriously.

Thought it would've been interesting to learn more about the evidence / science behind meditation.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] Relaxing, useful, and low-key. Definitely take!", "[0.75] [Autumn 2018] Amazing course, would highly recommend taking it", "[0.0] [Autumn 2018] More diverse exercises on meditation.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2018] Luskin is great! There were a few guest lecturers that were not that good. But overall, it's a good introduction to different meditation techniques.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2018] It's ok. Better than nothing, but not great.

I did learn so valuable tips, but found the class to be highly disorganized.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] I learned a lot in this course. I think Fred did a good job of teaching short meditations that are very accessible to a busy student's life. However, I did not like the replacement he brought in. also BEWARE the final is a 6-8 page essay that you're supposed to read 3 books for... a very bullshitable assignment but you still have to write it. The readings were very interesting and informative, and it did give a space for self reflection, but I wish that had been made clear in the beginning of the class. In the end, I am glad I took the class and skimmed at least parts of the books, but had I known that in the beginning of the quarter I may have opted to just audit the class, which a lot of people did.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2018] If you take this class for a unit, you will have to write a 6-8pg paper in which you must quote 3 books. This wasn't made clear in class (although it is on the syllabus) so it's definitely worth thinking about.", "[0.3] [Summer 2018] It is a good class for someone who is struggling with focusing attention, but it has a focus on negating the effects of bad emotions, so if you aren't a generally unhappy person you may still benefit but not as much.", "[0.75] [Summer 2018] take it to reach inner peace and self acceptance", "[0.0] [Summer 2018] try out the meditation techniques earlier on in the quarter.", "[-0.15] [Summer 2018] Taking this course over the summer is not recommended.

I believe that it has actually impacted how I deal with stress at school, at home, and within my relationships.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2016] This is a class in which you spend most of the time actually meditating. The instructor is excellent with teaching meditation, not so much on building any type of report with the class. The instructor talks during meditating, often about how we are \"safe here\" and how lucky we are. While this is a good class for those interested in meditation, it can be potentially triggering for those with PTSD or trauma histories who may find it a constant reminder of how they feel they \"aren't safe\".

It provides structure to guide you in the practice of compassion meditation, while providing space for flexibility and an understanding of what real life looks like.

She combines the academic and the spiritual (secular spirituality, I mean), which makes for a rich learning experience. Impactful and interesting readings. Not a ton of work--maybe 3-5 hours per week including class meetings. TOTALLY worth it. Life changing.", "[0.95] [Summer 2021] You should take this course! It's a wonderful experience in learning how to be kind to yourself and others, and to practice doing so. Especially in a world where self-criticism is the norm, knowing how to be and practicing being kind to yourself is a vital skill for success and simple mental health.", "[0.8] [Summer 2021] Amazing class, will totally change you way you view lovingkindness and compassion", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] There are many types of meditation. It can be likened to there being many types of sports. Every sport has a different goal and way of being played, but they're still called athletics. Similarly, every meditation type is different. The point of this type of meditation is to build your compassion for others and to summon the courage to face suffering (your own and that of others). If you're looking for breath-focused meditation to ease anxiety, you may want to try another class as this one is compassion-based and could deliver the same results, but that's not really the goal. \n\nThat being said, I really enjoyed this class and got a lot out of it. The readings are so interesting and made me believe that meditation should be a part of my life and not just something I say I'll get around to eventually.", "[0.7] [Winter 2021] This course is great for anyone interested in meditation. However, the class itself can be somewhat boring at times.", "[-0.25] [Winter 2021] This course will change your life. Compassion is an idea that is a long time coming. Our culture creates the idea that it's good for you to care about the suffering of others, but when you yourself suffer, this is to be dismissed and \"powered through.\" Such a mindset often leads to lot of unnecessary suffering, and this course gives you the tools to develop a healthier, more productive relationship with yourself. I also learned how to genuinely feel compassionate for others, which really just involves not getting in your own way.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] This class was incredible - Robert is an absolute saint, a kind person with a wealth of knowledge that he was so excited to be sharing with his students. He genuinely wants the best for you, and very clearly is a wise and thoughtful person. If you are considering this class, I cannot recommend it enough. Though it is 1 unit, there is a decent amount of out-of-class \"work\" - but that work is primarily in the form of daily meditations, which I found greatly improved my quarter and generally aided my time management rather than feeling like extra workload. Seriously, do yourself a favor and add this once-a-week lecture to your schedule.", "[-0.3] [Winter 2021] The biggest issue was with organization: meditation logs were meant to be a weekly assignment with feedback, however Prof Cusick was never able to actually create assignments on Canvas. We resorted to email him our logs, but received no feedback or email acknowledgement from him.", "[-0.05] [Winter 2021] You will learn so much about building empathy and how to develop compassion for yourself and others, even when it is difficult. \"Anger is like a hot coal; in order to throw it at someone else, you will be the one burned first and longest.\" You will learn to take negative emotions into perspective, and to accept them and move on. All in all, a very worthwhile class.", "[0.7] [Winter 2021] Excellent instructor and course transitioned well online", "[0.8] [Winter 2021] It was a really nice introduction to meditation and compassion.

It is a beautiful opportunity to reflect on yourself and your journey, and really deepen your capacity for compassion. Great framework provided, and steps for action are discussed. Robert was kind enough to share personal wisdom with us throughout the quarter. We built a great meditation community and it was a joy to come to class each week after practicing daily.", "[0.7] [Winter 2019] Definitely check it out, well worth the investment", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] Take it, if anything for the relaxation and positive group meditation setting.", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] This is a great class!

Highly recommend", "[0.6] [Winter 2019] It is worth taking and you will learn lessons valuable for life", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] Good class, but like all classes, try to actually buy into it, which may mean being extra deliberate to set aside the time to think about the course content, meditate, read related works, etc. That's how you can get the most out of the class, and Cusick is a great resource to talk to outside class, but there is little work in the class that is actually *required* for a grade.", "[0.65] [Winter 2019] This course gives you back as much as you out in. Whether you want to build your self-compassion, or learn more about the benefits, I highly recommend the course as long as you're willing to deducted 15 min per day (seriously, it makes a big difference)", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] A wonderful wonderful class.

Robert is absolutely fantastic and you will learn so much. I had no prior experience with meditation and I learned quite a bit without feeling out of place.", "[0.95] [Winter 2018] Take this course! It got me meditating everyday AND understanding why this was so important to my relationship with myself and others. Mindifulness and compassion (in my opinion) are essential to a fulfilling life and a successful society.

Not overly touchy-feely and with some science behind it for skeptics like me.  Online was still nice, but definitely a class I imagine is much tighter community-wise in person.", "[-0.1] [Winter 2021] This course was a wonderful once per week reprieve from work and the stress of life and was a low stress, low investment, high reward for my mental health and wellbeing.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] This is a fantastic class to learn the Sky Breath meditation style; if you are looking to improve your focus and calm, your sense of happiness and empathy, and to be more present and mindful of the simple joys of life.

This course would costly to take on your own outside of Stanford. The value and what you learn in two days is incredible. Dustin goes beyond repeating his lesson plan and course material. He was a master and answered our barrage of questions skilfully. While the course is taught quite close to finals, I can't think of a better way to prep the mind for the end of the quarter and beyond. If you have any interest in improving stress, anxiety, depression, well-being, positive emotions, gratitude, or concentration, this is the 1-unit course for you.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] Very thoughtful class aimed to help you start/continue your meditation journey.

Do be mindful that the way the course is set up is more of a lecture-style (I was expecting it to be more discussion-based), so keep in mind it can be a bit difficult to listen and stay engaged. Marissa is a lovely human and it definitely feels like a safe space, but personally I felt I didn't get as much out of the course as I could have (I was really hoping to build community and have a space to discuss my own experiences + hear others)", "[0.0] [Autumn 2022] Do it!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] An amazing and deeply comforting and helpful course.

This was the best class I have taken at Stanford.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] Take this class!! Marissa is so great.

This course does a wonderful job of fostering a queer community space and teaching ways to take care of oneself and integrate queerness into that wellbeing. Classes usually involve various different activities to relax and think about our relationship to ourselves and to others in the context of queer identity, as well as a lecture. The course also ties all of these concepts back to discussions of how systems of intersectional oppression uphold many of the internalized stigmas and harmful mindsets which the exercises and concepts we learn in class try to combat. The class environment is also great at holding emotional space for different healing needs and traumas. This course is so wonderful in so many ways.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2021] I absolutely loved this course. Each class offers a new lecture about some topic related to queerness, wellness, self improvement, or all of the above! In these lecturers you will mostly like learn something new or at least very least reinforce idea you have heard before in a refreshing and reassuring manner. The homework assignment are very straight forward and minimal, often it is a reflection that takes less than an hour to complete. I love that there is always room to ask questions in class. Although, I do wish there were more opportunities for small group discussions.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2021] Take it!

It's also always a great thing to be in a space where queerness is the norm!!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] It was such a wonderful course-- our instructor did a great job allowing everyone to be themselves and was very open to hearing about each individual's journey and perspectives on the day's topic. I learned so much about the overlap between my wellness and queerness journeys and I am so grateful this class exists. It was one of the few spaces where I felt fully seen and safe around a group of people I don't know super well, and I was excited to attend each and every class because of it.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Pay attention to the PowerPoints. The teacher is giving really helpful tips on managing stress and how to care for relationships with other people, and since there is rarely any in-class work it can be easy to get distracted by something else. Focus on the presentation and you will learn how to take better care of yourself.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Queer students should definitely consider taking this class. This class allowed me to put words to phenomenons and feelings that I have experienced being a queer person and opened my eyes to how I can better care for myself. The way progression of the course starts with understanding how white supremacy culture contributes to the marginalization of queer communities to self care practices enabled me to contextualize what wellness through queerness was for me.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] If you'd like an easy class to learn a lot about queerness and wellness, then I would highly recommend taking this course.", "[0.5] [Autumn 2021] Really chill, we stopped having assignments after the third week or so. Really great instructor and group of people.", "[0.5] [Autumn 2021] You are going to learn SO MUCH from this course! It was a course that I never knew I would need. You learn a lot about the mind, white supremacy, and self care. Dr. Floro is nothing short of amazing!

Most of it is focused on basic nutrition you could learn from reading a book. Once you get to the actual interesting bits about food trends, dieting trends, etc., it's more student-led and rushed.", "[0.5] [Autumn 2019] Very surface level nutrition science.

There is not much hard-science facts in the class because the research surrounding nutrition is hotly debated.

The homework takes minutes and it's essentially all for your own benefit.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] As a graduate student, I ultimately didn't think this course was a great use of my time. I would have preferred Dr. Robinson to take a stronger stance on what's healthy, what's not, how I can make concrete changes in my diet and lifestyle to improve my health. Instead there was a whole lot of \"science doesn't really know, X could be true or not, this diet could be good or bad\" and a lot of the \"learning\" was delegated to student research projects and \"what do we think?\" I don't really care what another student thinks based on their 10 minutes of research, I wanted to learn substantive facts from an expert, and just feel like I didn't get enough of that for this course to have been worth the time investment.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2018] great introduction", "[-0.2] [Autumn 2018] You should take it!

This was partially due to time constraints and partially due to it assuming no prior knowledge.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] A great overview of nutrition. The quarter is too short to get really in depth about any topic, but this is a great way to dip your toes into the water if you are interested in nutrition.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2017] This a great course for someone who wants an overview of nutrition and wants to explore the topic from a variety of angles.  It does not delve deeply into the chemistry or biology of nutrition, but rather highlights a variety of facets of food, eating, and diet.  The lectures were interesting, although I wish we had spent more time on diets, cooking, and mindful eating.", "[0.0] [Winter 2017] I highly recomend as a toolkit for understanding daily nutrition and discovering new questions.", "[0.6] [Winter 2017] It is really a lot of work for 1 unit and most of the information could be gathered in a day of reading up on the internet. The diet analysis project is useful but could be done on your own with enough motivation and there are 5 writing assignments and two projects.", "[0.7] [Winter 2017] Don't take it.  Nutrition could be a course where every week we leave saying \"Wow, I never knew that!\"  Nutrition as topic has the perfect mix of controversy, deep science, and personal relevance to make unforgettably interesting.  Instead, this class takes a surface level approach to every topic, makes little attempt to answer student questions, assigns a ridiculous amount of work, and sometime includes a cringe-worthy amount of forced story time participation.", "[0.65] [Winter 2017] I wish I did not take this course. The reviews were all quite good, but it was honestly a weird experience. The one beneficial aspect of the class was the nutrition/diet tracking assignment, because being forced to honestly track my diet in detail did show me when/how much I was eating, and what nutrients I was missing in my diet. However, I did not find the lectures to be engaging at all; the 1.5 hour sessions felt long and boring; most of the students were grad students and as an undergrad, I felt a little out of place. I would not really recommend this class.", "[0.4] [Winter 2017] Take it only if you're genuinely interested in nutrition and health. Lot of self study involved and a lot of work for 1 unit.", "[0.9] [Winter 2017] Recommend!  Great way to spend a few hours a week.  Jennifer is great.  More work than other 1-unit classes (weekly reflections, etc) but really interesting content that will make you re-evaluate the way you consume food!", "[0.75] [Autumn 2016] Take it! If you're interested in your health and wellbeing it will be really fun and insightful.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2016] It's a great course, especially if you know nothing about nutrition!

Really recommend whether you are  going through eating disorders, or just want to improve eating practices. REALLY REALLY AMAZING!", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] I would say that this class is better taught in person than online. It was hard to connect to fellow peers or form deep meaningful connections with others in the class, which is very important for topics as vulnerable and personal as mindful eating. Most of the class chose not to participate in group discussions so sometimes it really felt like talking into a void for those of us who did speak up in class. I would say that maybe breakout rooms would have helped increase participation. Hopefully, this course will be in-person next time and so it will be a much better experience.", "[0.25] [Spring 2020] If you have ever struggled with your relationship with food, want insight as to how to avoid mindless eating, and/or are interested in broadening your understand of hunger for clinical reasons, take this course!

If you want more knowledge of mindfulness with just a little bit of food knowledge, I would recommend this class.", "[0.9] [Spring 2019] It's a great class, but it's more work than one would expect for one unit. However, most of the work feels relevant and useful. It's also not designed to be \"therapy,\" so there's a clear boundary about how to phrase things in group discussions so as not to cross that line. However, sometimes that made it difficult to be honest.", "[0.15] [Spring 2019] This course is all about mindfulness and how it can be applied to a healthier relationship with food.

I experienced a family tragedy while taking this course, and Caitlin was very kind by directing me to a lot of mental health resources and sending me a lot of love and support. I'm glad that I took this course during this difficult time. The cohort is also very diverse and I learned a lot from peers who took this course. It's a safe space for you to be vulnerable.

It provides you the opportunity to do personal mental and emotional development while creating deep and meaningful connections with others to explore how you can optimize your life and the lives of others for well-being instead of profit/ego/power. I felt more belonging and community in this class than anything else academically I participated in at Stanford. It was key to my mental health and has huge potential to transform the ways students engage with their academic life and how they seek to affect the world in their work. I strongly endorse this course for being expanded to a full 3-5 unit course. In fact, every single CS major at Stanford should be required to take it but with students from other disciplines at Stanford because the different perspectives and how they meld was a huge benefit of the interdisciplinary nature of this course."], "WELLNESS 170": ["[1.0] [Spring 2021] This is my favorite class thus far in my Stanford career, and everyone who can should take this course! It is incredibly fun to be celebrated for embracing your inner child and being silly, and you are surrounded by people with similar feelings. Gigi is absolutely amazing and her passion for her job is clear. Not only do you get to exercise and play in class, but the readings provide justifications as to the benefits of these activities. The laughter buddies also give you a chance to work intimate relationships with people as you share the laughing experience, and overall I have growth a ton as a person through this course.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] This is such a great class! I had so much fun laughing with Dr. Giggles and really got a lot more out of this course than I was expecting.

It's a really accessible way to bring mindfulness and joy into your life", "[0.1] [Spring 2021] You are strongly encouraged to have cameras on the whole time and be very interactive during class.

If anything, it will make you a more integrated person as it did for me.", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] gigi is so sweet and knowledgeable!! she makes laughter yoga fun- but there is a performace, an essay, and weekly reflections. not too bad overall though- and met some new people through the class. would prefer shorter breakout rooms", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] GIGI IS AMAZING!!! Very fun class to take and it specifically helped me to destress during the week.", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] A great experience! Most fulfilling if you engage and aren't too shy, and it gets easier to open up every week.", "[0.5] [Spring 2021] Gigi is an incredible instructor whose passion for students and the practices she teaches is palpable in every class.", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] At first I found this course super bizarre and weird as it is not a \"normal\" class for most individuals. However, throughout the quarter I became a lot more acquainted with the bizarreness and accepted it. Gigi is also great at making people feel connected with each other, and does not push for anything too far outside of one's comfort zone. Overall, I really enjoyed this class and I think more people should try and take the class."], "WELLNESS 171": ["[0.95] [Autumn 2022] definitely take this course!

Just commit!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] The most beautiful part about this class is how you come together at the end and realise how you've created this safe, joyful community. It was truly a pleasure.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] Gigi is a wonderful source of joy all on her own, and I would recommend the class to anyone :) There's something very sweet and freeing about being able to let go of the day and let yourself laugh. I personally really enjoyed it, though I'm sure I could've gotten more out of it had I practiced daily/done more readings. I also personally really enjoyed the last day of class where we shared laughter exercises.

I thought the instructor was excellent. It was well organized, and the reading s and videos were worthwhile.   The time online was enjoyable.  I recommend this course.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Gigi has a unique way of leading the course which works to break down the barriers of allowing ourselves to be goofy, and carefree. She's also available, flexible, and caring. She really goes out of her way to understand the unique needs of each of her students. The reading material, written by the Dr. who founded laughter yoga, is perfectly in sync with the way the course is taught. Let go of any preconceived notions you may have. Allow yourself to participate fully without any care as to how you are being perceived. You will quickly realize the benefits of laughter yoga.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] This is a cute and funky little 1 unit! Really fun to take time out of the week each week to laugh and be silly with other people. You're gonna get the most of this class if you let yourself buy into laughter yoga as a concept!

Especially for FLI students that are unfamiliar with credit, investing, etc. I learned a TON and honestly might take another financial wellness class in the future. Definitely recommend.", "[0.4] [Spring 2022] If you are a FLI student, some of the course material is GREAT and will really help you with budgeting and understanding things like paying off debt, dealing with savings and credit cards, how to choose insurance,etc. However, the investment module felt really out of touch to me and assumed quite a bit of disposable income or large sums of inheritance. They talked a lot about how the only way to reach enough for retirement is to start investing early and \"stop exchanging time/labor for money, and start using money to make money\" which is all well and good, true even, but was really stressful to hear for me as a FLI student that will likely be living paycheck to paycheck until I am at least in my late twenties.", "[0.7] [Spring 2022] this is less a personal finance course and more a behavioral psychology course about how to set and achieve your (financial) goals. for more in-depth personal finance focus, take ECON43. Nothing wrong with this class, and I enjoyed it, it just wasn't quite what I expected.", "[0.85] [Spring 2022] Wellness 183 is definitely worth it if you don't want to take a full-on Econ course; it is a nice introduction to being more financially aware and thinking about how you want to approach managing your finances after graduation.", "[0.55] [Spring 2022] Take this class!

The skills it teaches are not only useful in building financial well-being but also in building all kinds of good habits and healthy lifestyles.

However, for students in other financial situations, I think this class could be really helpful immediately!

Otherwise, you\u2019d feel like you didn\u2019t learn anything.", "[-0.25] [Autumn 2021] The problem with this course is the way the information was presented. The Mind Over Money team member who they chose to teach this course is a little awkward in front of crowds and while she is very knowledgeable sometimes getting that knowledge out of her stories and lack of confidence speaking was a long process. If you need the units the way the course is designed it's easy to get them but going to class just wasn't engaging. If you're going for the info you can get everything you need off of the PowerPoint slides posted to Canvas. I probably wouldn't have taken it if I knew then what I know now.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] I would highly encourage this course to someone who wants to improve on their financial wellness but doesn't know how to get started.

I really appreciated all the things we learned in this class.", "[0.85] [Winter 2021] This class was very helpful overall but I want to point out how creepy and harmful some of the materials are. For example, a pre and post course assessment asks students to determine their level of agreement with statements like: \"In the long run, people get the financial results they deserve in this world\" and \"People's fortunes or misfortunes are solely a result of the choices they make.\" I feel pretty strongly that statements like this are not sufficiently trauma informed given the level of financial abuse and gaslighting marginalized communities have been subject to for centuries. I'm sure there's a better way the instructors could assess students' levels of self-perceived financial efficacy that doesn't reinforce this kind of violent, overly individualistic, and oppressive rhetoric. I'm really disappointed by this and hope something is done to the address how materials like this perpetuate harm for all students.", "[0.55] [Winter 2021] Interesting class.

Perfect for those with no knowledge on these topics.", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] Take this course if you are looking for a very basic and approachable introduction to personal finance! Also, the class is a great opportunity to interface with the Mind Over Money staff and learn more about all the amazing resources they provide. Though, the weekly lecture can get a little long and take a good chunk of time out of your schedule. But, you are allowed to miss 2 lectures, which makes it a more feasible commitment.", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] It gives some nice knowledge about financial services and behaviors. I would hope there's more chances to speak to financial advisors to really practice these skills", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] Definitely take it!

The tax section was super helpful, especially since they brought in an expert guest speaker.", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] This course was super helpful in explaining confusing and intimidating financial concepts.

It's a good one for real world skills.", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] The class is introductory, so I felt it didn't go too into depth on the issues I wanted to talk about but they made sure to let us know it would address the basics of financial wellness. The instructors were very willing to meet with you outside of class.", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] If you already know the basics of money, like taxes and what savings accounts are, you won't get a ton out of this class.

Guest speakers were pretty great though.", "[0.2] [Winter 2019] Learn important stuff for adult life", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] The course instruction wasn't very good, and I don't feel I learned a ton, but it was useful to gain an awareness of financial resources available through Stanford. I'd advise just meeting with a financial coach and going through the MindOverMoney tools on your own, but if you need a source of accountability to get that done, this course could be useful.", "[0.65] [Winter 2019] Definitely take it, especially if you're about to graduate! It's the only course like it and it's very practical.", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] Do not take this course. The topics that are covered sound much better than the information actually provided. Moreover, the instructors let Erika teach a lot of the class and she was really disrespectful to some of the guest speakers, treated students like we didn't know anything, and did not know much about financial wellness herself. She needs to actually know how to manage money before she teaches such a class.", "[0.7] [Winter 2019] Definitely take it!

It will really help you ground yourself before you graduate and are on your own", "[-0.25] [Winter 2019] It's worth it for the tools they give you and some of the advice, but overall class is kinda boring and only about 30 mins of every lecture has tangible skills you can use.", "[-0.3] [Winter 2019] A lot of the topics covered seem geared towards people starting from square 1, so if you have a bit more knowledge, you may not be as captivated", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] This was such a wonderful class!

The teaching team did just an amazing job.", "[0.5] [Autumn 2022] Very good course.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] I really enjoyed this class!! I took it for 2 units as a kind of personal sexual liberation project to feel less squeamish about sex, but I'm legitimately considering becoming a SHPRC counselor now. Everything we learned was so useful and relevant! I felt like an actual resource to my friends in casual conversations. I will say that if you give this class your full effort (watching the flipped lectures, studying for quizzes and the exam, etc.) it feels like slightly more than 2 units -- maybe 3. I kind of wish I was getting an actual letter grade for the work I put in. But I'm still glad I took it!", "[0.6] [Autumn 2022] Really informative course. I would suggest taking it if you didn't have an extensive sexual health class in high school. I will say though, the workload they expect from you is more than 1 or 2 units. There are biweekly quizzes, online lectures they expect you to watch each week, several chapters assigned every week, a 3 hour weekly lecture, an outreach project, and a final exam. Definitely more work than other wellness/physwell classes.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] 100% the best 2-unit class I've ever taken at Stanford. Even if you are not interested in becoming a peer counselor, you will learn so much! The instructors were so amazing, thoughtful, and kind. They would go the extra mile to make sure you understood everything they were talking about. The course reader is also very clear and I found the already short readings in it to be very interesting and informative. I cannot recommend this class enough.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] Awesome class! Even if you don't want to be a SHPRC counselor, it is still a great class to take if you are interested in sex education. Much more in depth than high school.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2022] Great for if your past experiences with sexual education were subpar and/or you want to become a counselor for SHPRC", "[0.8] [Autumn 2022] This class was so much fun and very informative! I learnt so much and cleared up lots of misconceptions I previously had. It really teaches you how to be safe sexually.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] If you are curious about anything sexual health, this is a very good class to take. The course reader is full of so much information that is just generally helpful to know. The teachers are so kind and inclusive and take any suggestions you would like to hear. The majority of the grade of the class is dependent on attendance, so if you show up with an open mind it is great! There are quizzes on the even weeks and peer counsels on the odd weeks.", "[0.8] [Spring 2022] This class has been elevated to my \"must-take\" at Stanford list. It's the sex-ed everyone should have had (and so much more). It helped me rewrite my own relationship to sex and my sexuality, broaden my understanding of intimacy to a more inclusive definition, and helped me learn about myself in ways I wasn't expecting. Plus, it's basically student taught. I took it for 1 unit, credit/no credit, and it was the best 1 unit I've ever spent.", "[0.8] [Spring 2022] This is one of the best courses I've taken at Stanford so far! I would highly highly recommend that any student take the course.", "[0.8] [Spring 2022] If you had terrible sex education in high school or just want a better foundation in sex ed, TAKE THIS CLASS! The teaching team is phenomenal. The course was very in-depth, insightful, inclusive, and not heteronormative. I love that it was pleasure focused and such a safe space. The readings were very easy and very manageable. Cannot recommend enough.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] Take it! It's a super warm environment and unlike any other course you will take at Stanford. The workload is relatively chill and the teaching staff are SO kind and caring.", "[-0.35] [Spring 2022] TAKE IT. If you did not have any sexual ed in high school or it was not that good, take it. This class taught me a lot and it fosters a very inclusive and diverse environment.", "[0.75] [Spring 2022] There is a fair amount of reading every week, with the first one being quite a lot and not as natural to retain, but it is a class work taking to know more about sexual health and to have open dialogue about topics many students are unfortunately uneducated about or misinformed about. With the knowledge e you gain form this, you will be able to serve as a useful resource for many of your peers on this topics that might help them in the future.", "[0.0] [Spring 2022] TAKE IT!!!!

As a student who might be or might not be interested in counseling, the course is able to still offer you something. I truly enjoyed the  character of the instructors and their dedication to the course. It is also a course where you can find the best and most supportive and understanding atmosphere on campus.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Take it! Easy and fun and open and loving.

This course taught me so much more sexual health than any high school sex ed class I have ever seen. The environment is very inclusive and feels like a form of community most of the time.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Take it! Super interesting, informative, and fun.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] TAKE THIS CLASS. Should be required at Stanford honestly. Even if you think you got enough sex ed in high school, 1. you definitely didn't, and 2. why not take more, and learn specifically how to talk to other people about sexual health while you're at it? As the quarter went on, I realized how many of my conversations on campus connected to material from this class. You don't realize it, but sex/relationships come up a lot in our everyday conversations as college students and now I feel informed, and so much more empowered and sex-positive in the way that I navigate these conversations. Prolly wont even be a shrpc counselor or anything either! Just glad to have taken a chill 2 units with a great class community.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] This class was one of the best classes I've taken at Stanford. Even on a topic that is considered silly, taboo, or outside the realm of academia, the class structure of unpacking racism, able-ism, sexism, and hetero-normativity in a peer driven course changed my thinking about sex and my own body. Even if you're not interested in counseling, the class provides you with great resources on sexual pleasure and safety for yourself and the Stanford community.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] Such a great course to take, regardless of any academic or career interests. The information you can gain from this course material and discussions are so valuable, especially for college students in a country where sex ed can be more than lacking in high school years. The workload is totally reasonable and lectures are enjoyable and interesting. If you are taking this class to counsel at SHPRC, make sure you know your stuff and study for the final exam and final counsel! It's not too hard but its good to be prepared and not rely on the course reader.", "[1.0] [Spring 2021] Take it! Loved the teaching staff, everyone was so kind and welcoming. As someone who did not have proper sex ed in high school, I learned a lot because we covered topics outside of just anatomy or heterosexual intercourse. There is so much under the umbrella of sexual health that is super useful to know in life so I definitely recommend this course!", "[0.75] [Spring 2021] Pretty cool class but probably way better in person.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] A wonderful course even if you don't want to counsel at SHPRC. Led by amazing TAs and was honestly such a great class with awesome discussions!", "[0.85] [Spring 2021] This is a great class to take for your current and future self, your friends, or to work at SHPRC. The information provided is way more comprehensive than you'd receive from a typical sexual health class from high school and it provides all the information together so you can make your own informed decisions.", "[0.75] [Winter 2021] It's a very close-knit environment. If you are looking for an inclusive space that is safe to talk about sex, then take the course! Staff and students are all open-minded and welcoming of all backgrounds.", "[0.7] [Winter 2021] Definitely take -- the people are so cool, and it's such a unique class at Stanford!", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] This course gave me such valuable and knowledge of sexual health that was inclusive of all identities and experiences. This course made me feel safe and comfortable to be myself and be mindful of my own sexual identity. I think that anyone could benefit from this course and the information taught is so important and will stick with you for the rest of your life.", "[0.8] [Winter 2021] This class is AMAZING.  If you're at all interested, go for it -- you'll find your people there.", "[0.75] [Winter 2021] very interesting and a very welcoming envrionment", "[0.75] [Winter 2021] Definitely take it! It\u2019s soooo much fun", "[0.45] [Winter 2021] Take it!! So important for everyone to learn about this.", "[0.75] [Winter 2021] This course holds knowledge that every student should know, as sex and hook-up culture is highly prevalent on college campuses. This course encourages being safe in regards to engaging in sexual activity, rather than telling students to just not engage in sexual activity completely.", "[0.2] [Winter 2021] This class is not only enjoyable, but also contains important info that everyone should learn!", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] This is a really great course if you want to staff at SHPRC, but also if you want to learn more about relationships, yourself, pleasure, and how to care for residents or friends.", "[0.9] [Winter 2021] AMAZING!!! THIS IS THE BEST CLASS YOU CAN TAKE AT STANFORD!", "[0.8] [Winter 2021] This was such an amazing class. The environment was so welcoming, supportive, and inclusive, and it was the first times I felt represented in sexual health course. The content itself is extremely thorough and inclusive, and expanded not only my knowledge of sexual health, but my understanding of how sex intersects with many different identities and the kinds of roles it plays in people's lives.", "[0.65] [Winter 2021] Take it take it take it! It is the best course offered at Stanford and it should be required.", "[0.4] [Winter 2021] Take this course. Gives students a sex-positive, inclusive, comprehensive sex education. If you didn't get great sex ed in high school, or if you want to know more about sex toys, sti prevention, anatomy and ovulation, birth control, etc, I could not recommend this course enough! Comes from a non-cisheteronormative lens. It's great!", "[0.9] [Winter 2021] This class is absolutely amazing and I believe valuable for every student. If you are curious in regard to anything about human sexuality and the natural variability in preferences, physiology, and experiences of the human condition, take this class!!!!", "[0.6] [Winter 2021] It's a great class, and I learned a lot about sexual health that I didn't know before.", "[0.4] [Spring 2020] Please take it!", "[0.4] [Spring 2020] Worth it!!!", "[0.0] [Spring 2020] Take it!!", "[0.4] [Spring 2020] I learned a ton from this class, and it was taught very well!", "[0.1] [Spring 2020] This class is amazing! Mahima and Molly were incredible TAs--too bad they're graduating. I learned so much about sex topics that really informed how I think about my own sexuality.", "[0.5] [Spring 2020] Take it, even if you have any level of interest! Everyone should learn these topics, and it's not just for people wanting to staff SHPRC", "[0.75] [Spring 2020] This class is such a great introduction to peer counseling and the topics covered are so important to being a modern progressive person in society and you will learn a ton about sex and sexual health that you have never been taught before."], "WELLNESS 192": ["[0.25] [Autumn 2022] The practices and class provided me with skills that I am able to foster my relationships with. It is such a good class but there is a lot of work.", "[0.25] [Autumn 2022] Its a very nice course but a bit too much work for 2 units", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] It's definitely a good class. You learn a lot about self-care as well as peer coaching. It's not too much work and it's a great way to grow if you want to get better at talking to and supporting your peers. The teaching team is really chill and kind, too!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] If you want to give better advice to friends/family or you want to work on your self caret, his course is helpful. the reflections can be overwhelming if you don't keep up with them so I suggest to stay on course as each reflection has its own activity. Colin and the whole wellness team are very welcoming and kind.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2022] The weekly journals should be edited down.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] A great class! Colin and the rest of the teaching class were AMAZING. There\u2019s also something about the class location that just feels so much more homey and comfortable than your average Stanford class. I\u2019d say if you\u2019re on the fence about taking this class, just take it. There\u2019s really no negative I can think of about this course, good vibes, good people, and important skills. I\u2019m the kind of person that often gets really nervous about asking the right question in questions, in keeping a conversation going, in being present for someone else. This class really helps with those skills and I personally feel like I\u2019ve developed a lot in those skills this quarter. Please take!", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] The journals will take more time than you think. But, they\u2019re very much worth the time. What you\u2019ll learn from this class will be very useful for the rest of your time on campus. Most of the well-being coaches dropped by, if not lead the class at least once, they were very cool :D Be prepared to do a significant amount of emotional weightlifting. If you\u2019re considering working for the Bridge but feeling nervous about the commitment (because EDUC 193A has quite a lot of homework) this class is a pretty good introduction. And it\u2019s not just about helping others, but also helping yourself. I took this frosh fall, and I feel like it really helped me maintain my wellness while transitioning to the rhythm of campus. There are also some very cool cooncepts taught in class (though that many) like the difference between mental health and wellness. Overall, it\u2019s such a great class, with snacks and engaging lectures.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] It's kinda a lot of work for just just two units but the teacher staff is super nice and supportive and it's a cool experience.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] Bri and Colin are very loving and caring people. I highly recommend this class. For me, it was an escape from the busy quarter days to discuss about things that matter - my wellness and the wellness of those around me.", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] An amazing course! The instructors are very caring and thoughtful, and the curriculum is very intentional. I would definitely take this class again.", "[0.7] [Spring 2022] It\u2019s low key a lot of work for a two unit class, but the teaching team is amazing.", "[0.7] [Spring 2022] TAKE THIS COURSE!!

The coaching/teaching team does a great job of creating this crash course on how to support and coach your peers.

Aneel is a really supportive and incredible mentor to have that you get to work closely with in a project like this.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2016] Definitely take it - it's a great opportunity to learn about whatever you're interested in, get units for it, and get to know your professor better through 1 on 1 meetings."], "WELLNESS 199": ["[0.5] [Autumn 2022] Great course, minimal time commitment, but incredibly practical.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2022] I would not recommend taking this class if it is only offered over Zoom again (in a year where all classes were back in-person). There was way too much emphasis on the ProBuddy Map for the little utility that it had. We could have focused on it for one or two weeks but it was a cornerstone of about half the classes, which felt excessive. I also felt like the class really lacked diverse perspectives, as the instructors and all but one of the guest speakers were white. There weren't many opportunities to connect with the others students in a class ironically about building relationships. Some of the guest speakers did offer meaningful advice, however.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2022] Definitely take it!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] If you are interested in learning to professionally network in an authentic and personally meaningful way, I would recommend taking this course. We had interesting guests and readings, and I enjoyed the topics covered. Given that the class was an experimental offering, it wasn't always well-organized, but I am ultimately glad that I took it.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2022] TAKE IT!!!! You will learn so much about how to be happier through professional and personal relationships. This is something we really need at Stanford. You will see that you are not the only one dealing with this and the assignments/guess speakers/assigned reading is very actionable in a Stanford student life context.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] I'd recommend taking the course! The people---the instructors, the guest speakers, the students---in the class are fantastic. BJ and Steven are super cool and have so much wisdom to offer. They are also so willing to support to students and are passionate about developing their students for their careers. The lessons from this class are lifelong. This course also attracts a great, motivated, and social group of students that are all willing to make new friends and connect more authentically. And of course, the guest speakers are very impressive and excellent at giving memorable and practical advice. The main thing is that students should approach this course with an open mind and be willing to invest in the advice they receive and find ways to implement and make meaningful changes based on what they learn from this course. The time commitment of the course isn't heavy at all, definitely not very demanding, but the more attention and intention you approach this course with, the more you will get from it.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2022] I didn't really feel like I got much out of it. We didn't do very much at all, there were only a couple of exercises. The whole class we just focused on our map of friends that we have. Advice seemed pretty basic. Would be nice to have more tangible things for us to learn and maybe even the science behind it. Was also on Zoom so it felt very impersonal and I didn't really get to connect with the people in my class.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2022] don't take it. literally your learning is a tertiary goal at best. you are a focus group, an experiment, a rat in a maze with no cheese.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2022] An interesting space to talk about relationships. The class would benefit from being held in person; despite the course topic, I feel like everyone in the class are still strangers!", "[0.65] [Autumn 2022] This is a great course. You get out of it what you put into it, so really use the tools they give you!", "[0.0] [Autumn 2021] Go for it!", "[0.7] [Autumn 2021] The Professor is the best. He is invested in the class and also the welfare of the student even after the course is over. You will learn how to lead a happy life in spite of the challenges in stanfors", "[1.0] [Autumn 2021] This is a great class for learning how add tiny habits to adapt your daily life. You will see how important looking at the bright side of things is especially to contribute to your overall happiness, and the importance of humor and how you can add that to your tiny habits repertoire.\n\nBJ is truly amazing. He will help you in whatever way you need. He is goofy and silly and wants each person in the class' life to change for the better after this class. He rocks.\n\nI highly recommend reading the book Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg (the professor) before class starts, so you can have a clearer understanding of the course from Day 1.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] Be careful. There is some victim-blaming language that the team is trying to fix and work on. I learned a lot of skills about self-defense and safety planning but this is a difficult class to take if you are a survivor. It is a marathon in one weekend which is incredibly difficult to handle. Overall the curriculum is great, just needs some tweaking in terms of language and being more friendly to survivors.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] This is an amazing course. Definitely recommend", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] The course was extremely helpful in dispelling sexual assault myths, helping us identify risk factors, physically defend ourselves, and also think about what we want in a healthy relationship.The course was a great learning experience that gave us useful skills directly applicable to our lives, I would highly recommend taking the course.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2018] Very interesting and has an important message.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] If you are female-identifying, and you want to learn how to protect yourself, I highly encourage you to take Flip the Script. It teaches you not just physical skills but also how to prevent bad situations from happening in the first place by being more aware of the surroundings. I felt confidence in the content they were teaching me since the program has been scientifically proven to have results. It gives you self-confidence and a chance to bond with other female students. Also, it's a fun way to spend a weekend doing physical activity, and they order delivery for lunch from nice restaurants.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2018] For Flip the Script-you should take this course, especially if you're a frosh. It's actually pretty fun and a good bonding activity, plus the strategies are not what you hear everyday and you can actually use them. It does not put the onus for preventing sexual assault on women.

If you have a pretty good awareness and working knowledge of finances it is less helpful. Take early on in your stanford career if possible.

Prior to taking this course, I had a conflicting relationship with Stanford, as I had fallen in love with the campus and the people, but was growing a dislike for the academic aspect of Stanford.

Most of the lecturers they invited are over-represented people on campus, and I was upset that in a class that focused so much on the land there wasn't even a session teaching us about the indigenous communities who used to own the land. Aneel tends to paint a simplistic and rosy picture of what Stanford is like, which corresponds poorly to the actual situation; the way he talks in class often makes me feel gaslit about my own experience of trauma imposed by this institution. Unless the teaching team addresses these issues, I would not recommend this class to anyone.", "[0.55] [Winter 2022] A bit too much work, but the speakers make it worth it. We also do some interesting meditations in which you get out of it what you put into it. Overall it was super fun, but the weekly reflections without a clear rubric were a pain in the ath. The readings also made negative 10 sense.", "[-0.35] [Winter 2022] Read the description and other student reviews before taking it. Was not the most enjoyable course, and it felt slightly dragged on at times.", "[0.45] [Winter 2022] a new course that reframes your thinking on college and gives you a bunch of skills to better your life", "[0.1] [Winter 2022] Take this class early  if you want to maximize your experience at Stanford.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] Take this class if you want to learn from a lot of different perspectives of very successful people at Stanford, which will leave you with lots of interesting takeaways. In the end, what you will gain from this class really depends what intention you take it with. You need to go into it with an open mind, and really focus on the parts that are meaningful and applicable to you, and leave the things that are not. I personally thought it was very helpful to have a class that forces you to slow down and be introspective, but I do think it depends on the person and what you want to accomplish. Also, I had to spend a lot more time on readings and assignments for this class than I thought I would for a 2 unit class, so time is also something to consider, because if you fall behind the class will not be as meaningful.", "[0.8] [Winter 2022] Take the class, it is interesting, fun and engaging, and you will learn things that will be applicable for the rest of your life.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Fun class, Tuesdays Dr. Chima does a fireside chat with someone from Stanford, and Thursdays you go to physical places on campus at get to explore them, its really fun! You do weekly reflections that often involve taking pictures of places you go to, so I recommend having your phone. Overall fun and the right amount of work for a 2 unit class.", "[0.0] [Winter 2022] It is much more than a 2-unit course. The weekly assignments and the midterm paper can get heavy since they are graded harshly.", "[0.7] [Winter 2022] Take it! Learn about Stanford through this amazing journey that Aneel and Katia take you on", "[0.8] [Winter 2022] All of the work was introspective, which I appreciate. However, I wish more of these experiences were validated and we had a chance to be more personal."], "WELLNESS 99": []}
