Not too much work. You will learn a lot about different types of energy and climate models, considerations that go into building and using a model, and how you might apply models to specific policy questions. You get to do hands-on work with models a little bit, but overall the course is at a pretty high level and you don't get into the nitty gritty details of complicated models. You do read some really interesting papers and can get deeper into the models if interested.

It varies a lot year by year, but the people in it are fantastic and bring such interesting diverse perspectives. The papers are really interesting and thought provoking, and the final assignment is well worth doing. It is a low stress class but you still learn a lot. Take it!", "[1.0] [Spring 2022] This is a very good class.\nThe format of the class is diverse and compelling with about one of the two weekly classes focused on discussion of short papers that everybody has to read. This means that there is a pretty consistent reading workload of about 1 to 2 hours a week with 3 or 4 questions on Canvas to make sure that everyone as read the papers. I think this was a very good format because it means everybody can engage in the conversation and there's no real pressure about what you actually write in response to the questions; it functions very effectively to get you to do the readings, which are very interesting overall. Also the diversity of the students in terms of programs and backgrounds (MSE, CEE, business, law both PhD and Master's) made for fantastic discussion.\nWe also had about 4 guest lectures, which were interesting for the most part, with a small caveat relating to the fact that the speakers don't necessarily know what's already been discussed in class and end up spending time on things that should be obvious for most students by then.\nThere are also 2 modeling problems during the quarter, which let you play around with Nordhaus' DICE model and a capacity expansion model. These were pretty great in how they are set up, with a lot of focus on understanding how the model works and trying to make physical sense of what is being predicted instead of getting pent up on coding. This lets you focus on improving modeling intuition. There's also a final project : a detailed research project proposal with weekly or biweekly milestones (less than 2 pages on different components of the model proposal. This is a good way of forcing you to think about how the things you've seen in class relate to a \"real-world\" modeling problem of interest to you. Also, the fact that you don't necessarily have to actually do the project afterwards means you can explore questions that interest you but don't necessarily see yourself spending a whole PhD on. Overall, I'd say that practical ground-up (or adaptation of existing) modeling is probably the only aspect of modeling that is not addressed very well in the class, which is not necessarily a bad thing since it would most likely be very time-consuming. There may be potential for this class to be offered for 3 or 4 units; the expectation for 4 units would be that you actually build at least parts of the proposed model for example.\nThe weakest part of the class in my opinion, which was not aided during the first two-three weeks of class being remote, were the lectures or mini-lectures, and possibly the fact that the chronology of the syllabus feels somewhat arbitrary. The quality of the mini-lectures was very variable; I thoroughly appreciated the lectures on uncertainty and environmental justice (the latter may have deserved a full lecture to allow for more discussion as we moved through it and could be a space to experiment with a more participatory \"brainstorming-session\" style lecture to try to list and think about how EJ, energy/environment policy and modeling are related). I think I mostly struggled with John's lectures because he easily goes off on tangents or shares stories which are not consistently relevant to the point being made.\n\nOverall, a very good class that tries to get you involved, requires slightly below-average but consistent amount of work and where you get to meet and exchange with cool people from quite a range of programs.", "[0.75] [Spring 2022] excellent! interesting papers and open-ended project", "[0.6] [Spring 2022] Great class to learn about climate models.

I didn't like these meetings because they are held sequentially after the guest speaker, so sometimes you have to wait 2  hours for your meeting. It's very inconvenient and this should be improved. I also think it would be good if the professor and TA were familiar with the coding environments the projects use so that they can help us. It would also be good to have more structure early in the course, like more structure homeworks in Thesys or Quantopian to get us familiar with the environments and their capabilities.

Like taking a sip from the Silicon Valley juice, no risk or strings attached.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] This class is run really well. I'd say though that you have to make sure you show up and take full advantage of the knowledge the class gives you in order to reap its benefits.

I enjoyed hearing about the lives of highly successful people because it reaffirmed my own goals and missions. Hearing not only about successes but also moments of doubt and failure, and then the ways in which these were navigated to build even stronger foundations for future development was very motivating, especially in the midst of the challenges and uncertainty of freshman fall. I enjoyed the level of interactiveness in the class, and that we were held accountable to reflect on our experiences so that each session had an intention and a meaningful outcome.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2022] I take this one every quarter.

The commitment isn't bad at all, so just give it a shot!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] This course is extremely easy to pass. If you do all the quizzes and attend the first few sessions, you'll be done by week 5. I presume the class would be interesting if you enjoy learning about the process of starting a company.

It gets a bit repetitive at times and is more of a motivational course than an instructive one (it doesn't give you technical tips about how to become an entrepreneur).", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] If you're even slightly interested in business, entrepreneurship, or need some inspiration for your life direction, I recommend you take this course!

This was my second quarter joining ETL talks, and frankly I'm quite disappointed based on the direction they've gone with the content. They seem to curate the guest speaker selection based on some sort of DEI metrics and how woke their company is. For example, they brought in this duo who made mobile apps to sell abortion pills and sex-change hormones. Another lady who is converting air molecules into some sort of fake meat product. There was one class with a venture capitalist which I was looking forward to (seems straightforward enough, right?), but Ravi proceeded to fixate half the discussion on... race in VC. If you want to become an entrepreneur, just go take one of Steve Blank's Lean Launchpad courses and dive in, maybe read Zero to One. I wouldn't waste your time on ETL.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2022] This is a great course that requires very little effort and will expose you to a lot of different information and people.

I though that the course would provide great insight into start ups or utilizing your college major as you enter into the society after gradation, but the questions asked by the instructor during the guest lectures were not the best questions. I only got a few valuable information. However, it is a pretty chill class, and you can listen to first hand experiences of successful figures.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] It was very little work. 1 unit means 3 hours of work, but there's no way you spend more than 1 hour a week on this. Great if you want to spend an hour a week learning about entrepreneurship. The best part of this class, however, were the occasional dinners and events, where it's easy to make great connections with others.

I like that we are able to take this course as many times because it allows us to hear from a range of speakers and learn from their experiences. A lot of the things they shared has stuck with me and I think others would benefit from a course like this as well. The hosts do a great job in enagaging with the speakers and allowing students to ask probing questions.

I've taken this class 4 times it's so amazing", "[0.75] [Winter 2022] Really good 1 unit course. Always very interesting", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Incredible speakers, but it felt like we were discussing more generic information that could be found anywhere on youtube. It would have been nice to dive a little deeper into the speakers' unique experiences (ie how to get funding) than their perspectives on vague topics like the future of AI. Besides that, very well organized class.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Very interesting to hear the stories of the different speakers.

It's important to note and everyone of them is extremely unique and had different paths to success. You can take bits of advice from each person to help you form your own path.", "[0.5] [Winter 2022] This is a very nice class to take especially with a heavy course load. It is fulfilling and allows you to see application of entrepreneurship outside of the classroom.", "[0.6] [Winter 2022] Awesome", "[0.75] [Winter 2022] Solid 1 unit with interesting guest speakers sometimes.

Excellent roster of speakers.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] I would recommend this course if you are taking MS&E 178 and interested in entrepreneurship. However, I would not take this class another without 178 as it is entirely online and therefore not that fulfilling on its own. Since the topics are similar to those discussed in 178, it is a great complementary course.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] This course is extremely interesting and features a diverse lineup of individuals from a variety of fields/professions that helps to inspire students as well as challenge them to think critically.", "[0.45] [Winter 2022] Good class to take, very little work and the speakers can be very insightful", "[0.3] [Winter 2022] If you attend lectures and pay attention, you will definitely get the most out of this experience and learn a lot from professionals.", "[0.65] [Winter 2022] Awesome course!", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] I highly recommend taking this course if you're looking for an easy one unit course that can give you valuable life and career advice.

Great class", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] The speakers are some really successful entrepreneurs like Chris Sacca, and the quality of the course entirely depends on the quality of speakers. The assignments for each week, if you're taking the course for credit, are 2-3 learnings from the talk- and don't take much time.

An easy 1 unit course that is very engaging.", "[0.6] [Winter 2022] Take the companion course for the additional unit if you can! It'll make sure you get more out of each guest speaker. I didn't and my roommate did, and I found myself doing much less active reflection about each seminar.", "[0.4] [Winter 2022] This is a very engaging class.", "[0.8] [Winter 2022] This is a great 1 unit class to up your units and learn some valuable information on the business world in different fields.", "[0.6] [Winter 2022] This course is great and teaches you a lot about the real world and business. Take this course", "[0.6] [Winter 2022] Fantastic course if you want to hear lessons learned about lived experiences in entrepreneurship", "[0.65] [Winter 2022] This is a great course to hear from speakers in an asynchronous setting.

I took this course in 2019 and really enjoyed it and was looking forward to it again. Unfortunately, this time I really was not interested in any of the speakers. I like hearing from people about their work and want to listen to people who are doing important things in engineering and developing exciting new technology. \nThis quarter was more of a QA style approach with the teaching staff asking a series of \"personal journey\" type questions to a series of cofounders and VC people. No guest was exceptionally interesting to me, and the questions focused more on the people's mindsets and felt really self-help-y. When I last took the seminar, it was a series of presentation by the guests about their work and journey with a short QA at the end. I liked this a lot more because the guests chose to focus more on explaining their work and why they were excited about what they were doing.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] Super interesting and easy", "[0.8] [Winter 2022] Awesome lineup of speakers! I'd recommend this class.", "[0.75] [Winter 2022] Absolutely take it. No additional stress, but lots of great life lessons.", "[0.3] [Winter 2022] The guest speakers are quite underwhelming and are often from startups or companies that people haven't heard of before.

A dearth of empathy or lack of effectual diversity seems to be present in that when spoken to by the lecturers, I realized, personally, that the lecturers seemed to be addressing a highly privileged audience (as some speakers would casually say). They spoke of lessons their parents taught about finance, writing checks, compound interest, networking, and the like. My parents did no such thing. They didn't know such things. I did not feel privileged. I felt other-ed and overlooked by this extraordinary opportunity. Many instances occurred like this throughout the quarter where instead of wholly focusing on the subject matter at hand, the subject matter itself drove me to think introspectively.

This course provides you with the opportunity to develop your own interests and connect with a range of people who are working within the field.", "[1.0] [Winter 2021] The speakers are AMAZING!! Professor Weyant is incredibly knowledgeable about the field, having contributed at the highest levels for decades. He is flexible with assignments and readings, and became even more flexible during the pandemic. You will learn a lot about the topic. \n\nKeep in mind that this course is MS&E and Professor Weyant is an economist. Thus, you will learn environmental policy from the lens of economics. Some Econ-focused lectures were somewhat difficult to follow if you haven't had Econ before. \n\nI highly recommend applying for the course, no matter what class year you are!! \n\nThe final project is really fun and you gain a lot of experience conducting literature reviews. The time commitment depends on what topic you choose. \n\nProfessor Weyant is very kind and keeps in touch with Alumni - there is a lot of opportunity for networking. He seems to know EVERYBODY in the field. He generously offers letters of recommendation and is excited to connect students with high-level professionals working in their areas of interest. The class is early in the morning, however, and the professor has a monotone.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] John is a wonderful lecturer, he always has a million and one stories to tell and incredible guest lecturers to rope in for lectures that will keep class lively and interesting. Would strongly recommend if you're interested in dipping your toes into environmental policy.", "[0.7] [Winter 2019] The guest lectures were very interesting if you're interested in the environment, and you really get to delve into an environmental issue of your choosing.", "[0.45] [Winter 2019] An easy A class, with only a presentation and a paper for the entirety of your grade. If you're looking for a traditional introsem however, do not take this class. Class is simply the professor lecturing at us for an hour and a half, and is not interactive whatsoever.", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] Absolutely take it. Professor Weyant is extremely knowledgeable, likable, and supportive. The project gives you the opportunity to explore a topic you are passionate about. Awesome guest speakers. Truly important and relevant content that everyone should know.", "[0.45] [Winter 2019] A good place to network and make green connections.", "[0.85] [Winter 2019] Great way to learn about current research and efforts related to environmental policy. Loved the guest speakers because they were big players in their fields", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] Take it! It's great that you get so much freedom to learn about a topic you care about and also be exposed a breadth of approaches to climate policy through the lectures and guest speakers. Profesor Weyant also truly cares about his students which is awesome.", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] This course gives a great introduction to environmental issues. Professor Weyant brings in amazing guest speakers, which was the highlight of the course for me.", "[0.85] [Winter 2018] Take it! Enjoyable, choose a topic you love for the final presentation. You'll be spending a lot of time with it!", "[0.25] [Winter 2018] All you have to do is show up for lecture and write a final paper. Might as well take the class.", "[0.0] [Winter 2018] Take it and do the suggested readings because they add a lot to your experience in class.", "[0.95] [Winter 2018] If you're interested in hearing about international climate talks from an active researchers and contributor, this is a pretty cool class! I also really enjoyed the guest lectures and hearing final project presentations from fellow classmates. Low time commitment, enjoyable class.", "[0.8] [Winter 2018] If you are interested in diving in to a specific aspect of environmental policy, I would really recommend this class. It provides a basis for what is going on internationally with env policy, but it also gives you the chance to pick a topic that interests you and learn a lot about that through the presentation you give and the paper you write. Additionally, the workload outside of the presentation/paper is very minimal.", "[0.85] [Winter 2018] Professor Weyant loves to talk. He's a pretty nice guy but if you want a chill class with some cool speakers take this.", "[0.8] [Winter 2018] It's an easy A, but not that engaging and fairly laid back. John is very nice and willing to go above and beyond for his students, but this is not a seminar. John mainly just talks for an hour and a half unless someone ask a question. If you do choose to take it, pick a project your interested in and go to office hours.", "[0.4] [Winter 2018] Professor Weyant is extremely knowledgable and can help you get more involved in the Stanford community for environmental awareness and such", "[1.0] [Winter 2018] This is a good introductory class to the issues surrounding environmental policy. The guest lecturers are for the most part good, and Professor Weyant is very nice and friendly. While I love Professor Weyant,  he has a tendency to ramble off-topic. I credit this to his deep knowledge and experience in environmental policy, which makes him a great mentor and resource for the final project. Find a topic that you truly have interest in, and he can help a ton while you explore and learn through it.", "[0.85] [Winter 2018] It's a fun, chill class where you are able to absorb a lot about the environmental policy world through Prof. Weyant and the guest lecturers. I'd definitely recommend it!", "[0.65] [Winter 2017] The final projects are very interesting, but lecture could be more engaging.", "[0.5] [Winter 2017] really nice professor, not an unreasonable amount of work. you learn a lot, especially if you don't know much about this field to begin with", "[0.5] [Winter 2017] This course involves a lot of listening to asides; they're relevant asides, but they're usually about Professor Weyant's connections or his accomplishments (of which there are many). But not much is actually taught about international environmental policy, or at least in a traditional sense. It feels almost more like an introduction to a career in international environmental policy, moreso than learning about the innerworkings of policy.", "[0.0] [Winter 2017] Laid back, informative class! Only major work is final research paper   presentation on this.", "[0.25] [Winter 2017] very important work. learn how environmental policy works."], "MTL 200": [], "MTL 273": [], "MTL 334A": ["[0.05] [Autumn 2022] This class wasn't great, there were a lot of us but only a few students kept on speaking (really they were just posturing for no reason), the material was too dense and Corey (the TA) was unintelligible...the class was organized pretty well but some of our discussions were really controversial and unprofessional...I'm not sure I'd recommend it honestly", "[-0.45] [Autumn 2022] Don't. Fundamentally, Harrison is a bad professor. He rambles in tangents and doesn't take well to questions ideologically misaligned with his own viewpoint. And his viewpoints will likely not align with yours if you don't think the only thing giving purpose to a woman is birth.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] TAKE IT! This class is definitely one of the best classes I've taken at Stanford (and this is coming from a fifth year, coterm student). The selection of readings is really insightful and diverse. As a non-humanities major, I was afraid I'd be lost, but the readings -- though definitely dense and hard to grasp at times -- were manageable nevertheless and Professor Harrison did a great job at breaking down the concepts covered in the readings. The class discussions were super interesting, and the people too. Would definitely recommend!!", "[-0.25] [Autumn 2022] It is sad that Professor Harrison will retire soon. Take a course with him if you have the chance.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] Take it! Robert is a super knowledgable professor, and the syllabus includes works that wouldn't be assigned in any other class. Unfortunately I believe this might be his last year, but the course was fantastic. Highly recommend!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] Take it! One of the best class I have taken at Stanford. Love Harrison\u2019s down-to-earth teaching style", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] This course is great; diverse and interesting readings as well as lively, engaged, and productive conversations in class.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2022] Take this course! Professor Harrison is an incredible professor, and if you put in the work and time, both the readings and the classes themselves will be greatly rewarding. Quite a lot of flexibility on the papers.", "[-0.5] [Autumn 2022] This is a course for those who have a real affinity for difficult (and depressing) philosophy. If that's your jam, then you'll be fine. For all those average, armchair philosophers out there... this course can be headache-inducing.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] The class this year was quite different from previous years, it seems. It was a good experience. You can learn a lot from the instructor and from the people in the class when the conversation is focused (it can be quite sharp when it gets there), even if in the first meetings it seems like the discussion is dominated by the snottiest people in the class who clearly haven't done the reading. The class works best when it is not derailed by people airing their thoughts on things that have nothing to do with the authors we're reading.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2022] One of the most commendable aspects of the course was its structure. The course began with a philosophical overview of theories of nihilism and then shifted to more creative and literary expressions of nothingness. The course does not aim to provide a working definition of nihilism, and is instead interested in showing the variegated amplification of emptiness and nothingness in a variety of cultural contexts, including colonialism, feminism, and continental philosophy", "[0.25] [Autumn 2021] be prepared for reading and discussing theoretical works.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2021] This is a very inspiring theoretical course. Prof. Hoyos is a very erudite scholar. Mitch is a very helpful TA.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2021] Good introduction to graduate-level texual analysis. You will read and discuss an eclectic group of thinkers (everyone from Kant to Debord).", "[0.35] [Autumn 2021] I would recommend it without reservations.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] This course provides an excellent overview of theory from a professor who evidently knows his stuff. Professor Hoyos's elucidations of everything from Hegel to Habermas, Du Bois to Debord really help students disentangle readings which can be quite hard going at times. Invigorating discussions held in a welcoming, fun, friendly classroom atmosphere. Highly recommended.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2021] For a student of any department or program, this is a course I would highly recommend taking. While the material can be challenging at time, the ideas discussed in Concepts of Modernity I underpin so many subjects in other areas of study and will prove to be applicable to any kind of academic inquiry.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2020] This is not an easy course - it requires a lot of intellectual engagement and critical thinking. If you fully commit, you will gain a ton from this class. I would definitely recommend this course!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2020] It's an excellent course to get to sample some of the major thinkers and ideas of modernity. If you are looking for a deeper familiarity with one or two of the writers there, then you will need to do some self study. But, again, great way to sample the many thinkers discussed in the course.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2020] An extremely helpful overview of some key and novel lens for theorizing modernity", "[0.9] [Autumn 2020] Be prepared to read difficult texts, but also enjoy a sweeping breadth of materials that will give you a solid understanding of what exactly is and isn't modernity. You'll come out of it with more questions than answers, but to me that's the sign of an excellent course.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] The class provides an interesting and somewhat helpful overview of modern theory, especially to those previously unfamiliar with it. However, its syllabus this year was rather eclectic, and not in a very productive way; the effect of constantly jumping back and forth in time and theme, without very substantial connections being made across units, was more confusing than enlightening, and ultimately I did not feel that we sufficiently covered most of the material we read. The reading load was *very* uneven from week to week, and often unreasonable (e.g. one week the entirety of Freud's Civilization and its Discontents was assigned, on top of Nietzsche's entire Genealogy of Morals, *as well as* a Foucault article and a secondary essay on Nietzsche; the next week, the reading was a meagre 60 pages). Many of the readings were never discussed, adequately or at all, in class (e.g. Civilization and its Discontents...). Perhaps more lectures would have helped cover more of this often difficult material, especially as I felt that the class was simply too large for the seminar/discussion-based format to be a very effective learning method.", "[0.3] [Autumn 2019] Hoyos provides a fascinating, critical perspective of modernity. Take the class.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2019] Great course! Professor Hoyos is a world class thinker - definitely take it if you can.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] There is a lot of work and reading, but it will be as rewarding! It also requires an open mind and willingness to challenge preconceptions held by yourself. I highly recommend it!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] I would definitely recommend the course to any students if Professor Hoyos is the instructor. This is one of the best theory courses I have ever taken. And, as the case for most amazing classes, there is so much to be learned that is transferable to other aspects of academic life.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] Great opportunity to read and critically analyze some major figures of a certain knowledge tradition who impacted generations of scholars. Also, the course is a mini-laboratory for improving graduate-level writing skills.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2018] Take it. This course will give you the groundwork on which your academic career in the humanities should be built. Not only is it comprehensive in its scope, but the level of detail and close reading paid to texts and thought will give you the confidence and skills to approach the densest of theories.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2018] Take it! Professor Hoyos is remarkably well-read, witty and keen. Just be prepared to work more than anticipated.", "[0.25] [Autumn 2018] absolutely take it. Hector is an incredible discussion leader, adept at explaining and tying together very complex ideas, as well as the authors behind them.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2018] It's a really interesting class, and Hector outdid himself by rethinking the Syllabus.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] This course is amazing, so rich and overall the best introductory-type course I've seen in the DLCL. Do it.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2018] Great introduction to modern thought, but the level of engagement with the texts is very superficial.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2018] Everyone enter grad school in humanities should take this course. Prof Hoyos is incredible and patient and one of the most engaged professors I have ever met", "[0.7] [Autumn 2017] Wonderful instructor!  Worth it just for that.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2017] This is a solid foundational course for students of theory. It is a survey, so expect more in terms of breadth than depth. The course instructor is supportive and open to a range of interpretive possibilities. Feel free to critique the texts as you learn them -this is one of the strengths of the course.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2017] Read smart, and don't be afraid to read ahead. The initial few works are pretty dense; after that, it gets far more accessible (and enjoyable). Lots of great stuff here!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] Since it's a required class for the MTL program, I enjoyed having a chance to get to know the new cohort of students, as someone who's coming from another department. The conversations were always open and productive, and everyone in the class contributed unique perspectives on pretty much every topic. It was the highlight of my quarter!", "[0.45] [Autumn 2017] Dr. Palumbo-Liu is phenomenal. Not only is he thoughtful and reflective with his comments, his knowledge spans the spectrum and he is often able to relate discussion to any number of events past or present.

Dr. Saldivar is the best. Would wholeheartedly recommend with no reservations.", "[0.7] [Winter 2022] This is an enjoyable course in which I learned a lot. I really appreciate Professor Saldivar's explanations of Foucault, and that we spent a bit of time looking at the early Foucault.", "[0.6] [Winter 2021] the readings are great", "[0.8] [Spring 2020] This is a great course! Vaughn introduces us to important discussions in various fields and to the different theoretical stances that scholars take. His approach to studying modernity through a variety of fields provides various lenses and creates a multifaceted approach. We discussed modernity from the perspective of colonialism, enlightenment, diaspora, and secularism.", "[0.6] [Spring 2020] Great course and readings", "[0.55] [Spring 2020] I found it the most productive to have an imagined conversation with yourself (or your alter-ego) first before you come to the class. In other words, learn to tell a story to yourself first about the readings, then it becomes more rewarding to listen to other voices during class", "[0.75] [Winter 2019] This course is great if you want to get an introduction to different perspectives about modernity, coloniality, and culture, especially Latino culture. If you take this class make sure to participate in discussions since professor Saldivar can lecture for the entire class.", "[0.1] [Winter 2019] This course depends so much on who is teaching it, I think. Take it if you want an occasion to think about broad theoretical questions of modernity, etc., and hear more about what kinds of scholarly questions the professor is thinking through right now.", "[0.0] [Winter 2019] You should take it! Even if it's not required.", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] I thought the readings for the course were interesting, but the \"discussion\" element wasn't really a discussion. A student taking this course in the future should be ready to get the most value in the course out of the readings", "[0.75] [Winter 2018] A good survey course on Western modern thought, which also problematized that thought. Taught by a professor who provides the right amount of push-back on your ideas and assumptions. Good course!", "[0.9] [Winter 2018] This course may carry a heavy reading load, but it's a great way to familiarize yourself with a general sense of what the Enlightenment means today. I found this to be an interesting balance of related concepts, and certainly something that will force you to learn more about ideas/topics/writers/thinkers you may not have considered previously.", "[0.85] [Winter 2018] This is a great class, and Prof Rasberry is awesome.", "[0.85] [Winter 2018] A solid course, required for MTL PhDs, that has an interesting reading list, but could use more structuring/lecture-based synthesis by the professor to give a stronger contextual grounding for these works.  Almost feels like a Concepts of Modernity III class, with a missing II class that would have been a valuable bridge between the first class in the sequence and this one.", "[0.6] [Spring 2017] A great course for any graduate student in the humanities.", "[0.8] [Spring 2017] The texts Dr. Rasberry chose are really great. Talking one on one with the professor is also incredibly useful."], "MTL 334C": ["[0.85] [Spring 2022] I'd definitely recommend it! My only hesitation is that sometimes, the structure was a bit stressful -- there was a fairly hefty assignment every other week, and no syllabus, so it was difficult to plan for in regards to time-management. But I really enjoyed the course itself -- Prof. Mullaney is wonderful, and his assignments really pushed us to think about our projects in new and different ways.", "[0.0] [Spring 2022] By all means, take this course.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] It is the absolute best way to begin your PhD career! Tom is such a warm human being whose encouragement is equally matched by his knowledge of the field of interdisciplinary studies. You are in good hands.

Keep in mind there is no in-class production instruction, but learning how to use a DAW like Ableton or FL studio is very feasible and fun via trial and error.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] Loved the instructor and how creative everyone in the class is! Super fun for beginners!", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] This is a really fun class and is definitely a great course if you're interested in learning a mix of the history of electronic sound alongside getting experience working in a DAW. Class lectures and the readings felt low-stress, and the projects were really fun to get into since they are so open-ended. It's emphasized a lot that this class is not a production class, and for the most part I had to learn how to create the audio effects / sounds I wanted on my own as there was not a lot of specific structured support for stuff like that in the class. I really enjoyed my time in the class, would strongly recommend for people considering it!", "[0.7] [Autumn 2022] It's not a production class, but more of an immersion class to the different forms and techniques and styles of electronic sound. It's quite heavy on exhibition too - so be prepared to share your music with others!", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] super super cool. if you can, take it. no matter your musical background (completely beginner or advanced/knows how to work in a DAW), you can learn something from this class. honestly my favorite class in a while. super super fun --- take itt!!!!!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] Take it if you can!

People come in with insane music production skills, and it was inspiring to hear their creations. I wish beginners like myself were given more formal instruction on how to work with the DAW. I had to self-teach myself on YouTube, but that didn't get me very far. That being said, I'm proud to have a few cool projects under my belt. I wasn't as interested in the history element of the class, but I did learn about a few new genres of electronic music and I enjoyed some of the readings that discussed different types of listening. The workload is reasonable overall.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] This is a great course! The assignments are very open ended, which gives you a lot of space to explore your own interests as an artist. If you're interested in making your own music, meeting other musicians I highly recommend", "[0.75] [Winter 2022] Take it! A super worthwhile introduction to producing and recording electronic music.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] I would definitely recommend taking this course! Professor Virzi has such a rich knowledge of sounds and music software and I was so grateful to have been able to learn so much from him. I\u2019m interested in pursuing music beyond college, so taking this course and learning not just how to make music but how to create and edit computer sounds in general was a great first step on that journey.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Fantastic class.

Make sure you are willing to put in work on the creative assignments.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] My favorite part was listening to everyone's assignments and giving feedback. Nick was super constructive with his feedback and gave me tangible things to work on.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] This is a great course for anyone who is interested in sound and music in its various thematic and creative dimensions. Do note that it is more of a class teaching you the historical background and abstract concepts of electronic music, not a production-oriented class. While support for software/DAW-related questions and issues is available, they are not the focus of the course so you will have to spend your own time figuring it out. The projects are fun and interesting, and Stephanie is super nice and accommodating and encourages you to explore creatively without being constrained by set rules or limitations. One aspect of the course I did not enjoy as much was the numerous Slack discussion assignment posts. There were way too many of them (at times we'd have like three readings, three listenings, and a 1.5-hour long video in one week, and we'd have to write commentary on all of them), and having to write for every single one of them felt like busy work with minimal educational value especially since many of them weren't things we spent a lot of time discussing in class anyway. But overall a worthwhile, low-stress experience!", "[0.0] [Spring 2022] Take this class!!!", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] Excellent course. Thoughtful teaching team, supportive class, lovely environment to create in.", "[1.0] [Spring 2022] Past reviews have warned about the work this course will require, but I really suggest you take it to heart. Especially for those who don't know how to use a DAW yet (Logic/Ableton/Garageband etc) and want to learn how to through this course -- you will have to do that learning completely outside & in addition to this course and it's a lot to take on. I felt really overwhelmed in the first few weeks having to do so much learning on my own, especially since there were multiple reading/listening/media Slack assignments per week on top of that. Stephanie has mentioned they might scale down the Slack assignments from now on, so hopefully that will be more manageable. \nOtherwise, Stephanie is a really great instructor -- they are really experienced in their field, and give very lucid and insightful feedback as they are very experienced in evaluating musical/sound work. I also love that they are intentional about the material they select for readings/listenings/guests, centering BIPOC & queer artists, histories, etc. They made multiple concessions this quarter to help us catch up on our work and get a better grade and really care about their students. I would advise you to actively volunteer your work during feedback sessions as it's really important and it's a good way to grow.", "[0.75] [Spring 2022] Stephanie is an amazing instructor and is very knowledgable. Please take this class!", "[0.7] [Spring 2022] Give yourself space to explore. Don't worry to much about the technical knowledge or music theory--trust your ear and have fun!", "[1.0] [Spring 2022] Great great class! Stephanie and Angela were both wonderful. The creative projects run in parallel to the more historical content of the course, and there is no direct instruction for music production skills - it was nice to have experience with a DAW, but I think if you want to learn it, you'll have to jump in at some point. Wonderfully curated content, such a warm space for learning and sharing creative work, and great opportunities for community connection :)", "[0.75] [Spring 2022] It is a lot of work but a great class overall. Try to take it in a quarter when the workload from other classes will be relatively light.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] Stephanie is great at keeping everything organized and is generally very chill and understanding of students' situations. The readings/listenings/viewings really aren't at all strenuous compared to a lot of other classes, but take care to not let them pile up, since there is usually at least one response due every class. If you're truly a beginner to making electronic music, the class can be pretty intimidating and discouraging at times, since a lot of it revolves around listening to peers' music and getting feedback, and a lot of students in the class already have vast experience with the course content and may have already been professionals/semi-professionals in the field. Additionally, the class will be a lot of work without prior experience, just in terms of figuring out how to work in and make music with a DAW. Still, a very good introduction towards this type of music making if you're interested.", "[0.7] [Spring 2022] I would take this course if you have any interest in electronic sound and music! Be ready to take the time to learn how to navigate the DAW if you don't have any prior experience.", "[1.0] [Spring 2022] If you are even the slightest bit interested in music production, TAKE THIS CLASS. This class was absolutely worth it all around, from the content to the learning experience to the professor Stephanie. Overall, you learn so much about electronic music and its history, allowing you to understand the nuances behind those who developed the genres. The reading, listening, and media assignments can be a lot at once, so make sure to get on top of them, but they are definitely worth it to deepen your understanding. The assignments are all-opened but still accessible to a music production newbie like me, giving me the space to explore and be creative. Stephanie does a great job of going into critical topics and really engendering this space that's open to everyone's music tastes and ideas. The community of the class made me excited to go each day, even though it's a rough bike ride uphill to the Knoll. Overall, take this class and pour as much time into it as you can!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] A cool class for sure! I liked the creative process, though I did feel like class time was too long and I got a little bored. The projects are a good opportunity to explore production, though you do have to figure those techniques out yourself. Stephanie is very accommodating and cool.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2021] A great course. You can still take this if you don't have a musical background.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] This course is perhaps one of the best classes on campus. Too many classes restrict creativity and enforce conformity. This is not one of them. You are encouraged and challenged to think outside of the box and forced to do so by learning how to use DAW (LogicPro, GarageBand, Audacity, etc.). This class reminded me why I came to Stanford. It is demanding by extremely rewarding. Be prepared to be creative, authentic, vulnerable, frustrated, excited. MUST TAKE.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] This course is a ton of fun. Like the description says, it won't teach you how to use a DAW or make music, so be prepared to learn a bit of software, but mostly be ready to take your current musical skills and apply them to the class, as the projects are very broad and you don't need to create a lot of original traditionally musical components to excel and have a great time. I highly suggest taking this class.", "[0.4] [Autumn 2021] DO IT DO IT DO IT DO IT you will learn so much!! It's going to totally change the way you think about music and your own capabilities to make music! Just stay on top of your work and start things as early as possible so you don't end up having to submit music you worked on for an hour.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] You should know what you're getting into -- this class is essentially a history/analysis class for Electronic Music, not a production class. You won't learn production techniques or anything, rather, it's all based around listening and analyzing existing works. You'll listen to a lot of cool pieces and learn a ton about the history of electronic music, but if you're looking for a production class, you'd be better served with 192a or watching youtube videos. That being said, if you do want a history/analysis based class, you're in the right place: Stephanie's cool and she brought in a lot of great guest artists this quarter. Workload is fine; it's all based around a series of open-ended short projects.", "[-0.1] [Winter 2021] Stephanie is really nice. The assignments are really interesting. But the use of DAW is not taught in class, so it's a bit hard to start off when you have no foundation at all.", "[0.35] [Winter 2021] It's a great course about history and expanding your understanding of what music is, but it doesn't actually teach you any techniques of music production.", "[0.9] [Winter 2021] Have lots of fun! You should be exploring the sounds and material that interest you the most. You're given a lot of freedom, so use it.", "[0.45] [Winter 2021] be wary of taking this course without prior experience. this class does not have prerequisites and does not teach any mixing techniques or even how to use a daw, but expects you to create a music production project every week\n\n\n\nreally fun to make the projects, but if you come in with no background like me, you will need to do a loot of extra work to learn the basics and how to work your way around a daw", "[0.4] [Winter 2021] In Music 101, you can channel your creativity with a purpose. Whether it be by exploring the voice, sonic landscapes, or sampling methods, this class enables you to synthesize topics from readings, listenings, and media studies into your own work.", "[0.5] [Winter 2021] It is a lot fun if you approach the course willing to learn.", "[0.75] [Winter 2021] Highly recommend! You learn so much! Although the work may seem like so much at times, you'll get so much out of it if you take the time to do it!", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] This is a great class to take if you want to express yourself or if you feel like you have trouble expressing yourself. Professor Sherriff and Raul offer great encouragement and tips to better your work.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2020] In my opinion, you will probably get a lot more out of this course if you are already familiar with a DAW and basic musical concepts. The course kind of becomes what you want it to, which is really cool.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2020] This class was different than I expected, but was more amazing than I could have imagined. It is not a technical class! Don't expect to be taught about how to use a DAW or make recordings. Instead, be prepared to explode your concept of what music is and expand your perspective about how it can be made with electronics. You'll learn about the musicology of electronic music with readings, listenings, and videos and engage with them by writing short, fun responses and discussing with classmates. Topics included recording technologies, field recordings, synthesizers, noise music, techno, hip-hop, and vaporwave. With the project assignments, you'll get a lot of experience with different approaches to making music with electronics, including recording sounds, sampling, and using the DAW to compose. This class was super beneficial to my music making process. Though the class was demanding, I had lots of fun and got to make some music I am proud of.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2020] This course is very interesting. You don't require any type of musical background, although it can help. At the start of the course, there is a learning curve when adapting to a DAW (GarageBand, Logic, Audacity,...). Overall, this is a fun course to take if you are interested in composition.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2020] Stephanie is amazing. There is a lot of work. I wish there was more hands-on tutorial that describes how to go about digital audio workfaces and music notation software.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2020] The best part of this class was the class discussions, which really just depend on how engaged your classmates are. Stephanie brings a lot of interesting topics up and can orchestrate interesting discussions. However, she sometimes gets frustrated and takes it out on her students.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2020] This class was greatly accessible, even for someone with relatively little experience in composition and sound mixing; my cohort included examples of both, but that didn't prevent them from producing very successful, entertaining works.", "[0.3] [Autumn 2020] This course is an essential introduction to electronic sound. It is not a production class, but that is what makes it so unique and worth taking. Instead of learning recording technique, you will be exposed to the breadth of electronic sound and music.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2020] This class is a great intro for people trying to learn about how they can explore their musical interests. This class won't really teach you how to use your DAWs or any of the technical aspects of mixing and mastering. This class is easy if you have some background in producing music.", "[-0.55] [Autumn 2020] I thought it would be more centered around teaching technical elements and how to actually produce using our DAW, so that was kind of disappointing.", "[0.65] [Spring 2020] Great class!", "[0.35] [Spring 2020] Worth it!! Stephanie is a chill teacher", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] Take this class! Stephanie is an amazing person and professor who is super willing to help you learn what you want to learn and meet you where you are in terms of sound creation. They also are clearly invested in their students and want to have an actual human relationship with you. I learned a lot in this class and I had a super good time doing it.", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] Definitely definitely take this course! 100% recommend.  You will learn so much about the history of recorded music genres and your perceptions of what \"music\" really is will be challenged. Stephanie is the best and if she's teaching it, then I will update to a 200% recommend.", "[0.8] [Spring 2020] This course is wonderful! If you think you might be at all interested, take it!", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] I had a fantastic time in this class and really enjoyed the course's accessible approach to music, electronic sound, and the creative process! Would highly recommend for anyone to take-- regardless of experience.", "[0.25] [Spring 2020] Cool class, but don't expect to learn many practical DAW skills in lecture; the lectures are fully on the history of a few genres of music (such as noise music, sound art, etc) and while the assignments are compositions on your DAW of choice, there is not much coverage of DAW workflows in the class so know what you're signing up for!", "[0.75] [Spring 2019] You get what you put in. You must be motivated and have time to learn by yourself, if you want to produce something good and get something out of this class.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] Definitely take it. I would recommend having some prior knowledge about music production beforehand -- knowing the jargon helps. I found it fascinating and great for expanding my technical knowledge.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] If you're interested in recording sound (particularly music), this is an essential course. I already had experience with home music production, but I still learned so much. Eoin is awesome; he seems to have revitalized the CCRMA recording space in the recent years. Helps to use Logic as a DAW, but I used Reaper for free and it worked well too.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] This is my favorite course I have ever taken on any subject. Not only does it teach the practical skills outlined in the syllabus (related to how to create electronic sounds), but such a deep and foundational understanding of history and theory that makes the experience so much more rich and purposeful. Even beyond this, I feel like I learned a great deal about the mindset to bring to the activity of creating sounds (including the need for experimentation / making \"weird\" things). This is all blended in a cohesive experience that I am eternally grateful to have experienced.", "[0.4] [Spring 2019] just yes.", "[0.65] [Spring 2019] this is the best class you could ever take at Stanford, in my opinion", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] Take it! Eoin is a wonderful guy who genuinely cares about the pieces that you have to create throughout the course. This class will really allow you to become a better listener and kickstart you with the tools to start creating your own sounds/music.", "[0.6] [Winter 2019] Great course to learn about production regardless of your skill using DAWs", "[0.85] [Winter 2019] I would definitely take it if they are interested in anything involving audio, especially music production. It is a really great introduction to the basics of audio", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] This course is a lot of work for those (like me) who come into it not knowing much about composition or sound in general.  Still, it's worth it and Eoin does an excellent job teaching to various levels in the same course.  Eoin's ear is incredible and his precision will make you feel like you're a blind person learning to paint - but I'm told everyone feels that way next to Eoin.  He's generous and kind with his feedback and will encourage even the worst of students to keep trying to improve towards their personal goals, humble as they may be.", "[1.0] [Winter 2019] If you are already decent at producing, this class will do nothing for you. It's very very basic. The listening assignments were a great opportunity to do something cool, but I was disappointed because pretty much all of them are hour-long YouTube videos of weird sounds instead of real electronic or popular music. It's a fine class, and you'll have fun, but if you're trying to learn to produce, I'd say you're much better off with just learning from YouTube videos. Cool people take the class though, so if you're trying to have a pretty chill four units and maybe find some people to jam with, it's a good idea.", "[-0.2] [Winter 2019] Take it! It will expose you to a wide range of (and history of) music/sound/audio that you probably wouldn't encounter otherwise", "[0.65] [Winter 2019] Awesome course! Take it if you want to be exposed to some really eclectic works and hone your mixing skills.", "[0.45] [Winter 2019] This was my favorite class of the quarter, by far.", "[0.85] [Winter 2019] Eoin's a cool guy. The homework is a lot of listening to cooky sound art pieces, along with more conventional music. You'll learn a lot about sound, and the importance of listening carefully. It's an excellent class.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2018] It's an amazing course but be prepared for a lot of work. You learn a lot, provided that you can put time into it", "[1.0] [Autumn 2018] This is a great class for getting exposure to the world of music production and electronic sound in general! Things like EQ, synthesizers, ADSR envelopes, etc. are covered in this class and it's extremely helpful to be familiar with all that vocab. I really don't love Ardour, but at least it's free. Logic is much nicer (but that's of course no fault of the class). Eoin is awesome and helpful and clearly passionate. I could've done with a couple fewer reading assignments, I don't think I super needed that much history, but it was cool to learn some of that too. Highly recommend if interested in music production in the 21st century", "[0.4] [Autumn 2018] it's a tad hard to conceptually move from making sounds to making full songs or musical elements. it would be dope if there were some lectures in class dedicated to bridging this gap", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] Take it if you are interested in learning how to create a mix on your computer.  Very interesting class that will definitely challenge you to think about what is taught.", "[0.45] [Spring 2018] Low-key, this course is a lot of work!  Take for 3 units, if you want to avoid one of the two book reports!  Can pass with a B without doing the one mandatory book report.  Otherwise, this class is a powerhouse of useful information.", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] Take this class! Eoin and Megan are great instructors who are truly passionate about this field and care about their students' success deeply. Definitely recommend this course.", "[0.85] [Spring 2018] It is a lot of work but is very interesting and fun", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] Even though this class is a lot of work, it was my favorite class this quarter. I loved the material, gained exposure to many different tracks and electronic pieces that I had never heard of or listened to before, and had the chance to practice using a digital audio program and create my own creative sound projects. Eoin is an awesome teacher, always provides helpful feedback on assignments, and sticks to a very organized schedule that is accessible on the class website.", "[0.3] [Spring 2018] It's a cool class to learn about music production. Sometimes the readings were a lot.", "[0.85] [Spring 2018] This is a great course. Eoin is amazing!", "[0.95] [Winter 2018] Take it!! I loved it, Mr. Callery is an amazing, accomplished teacher who is passionate about electronic music and is very down to working with you individually", "[0.85] [Winter 2018] It's super cool 10/10 would recommend", "[0.5] [Winter 2018] Definitely take it if you have no introduction at all to music production and are interested.", "[0.9] [Winter 2018] Definitely take it and put in a lot of effort! Eoin is a great wealth of knowledge!", "[0.5] [Winter 2018] if you have any interest in music production take it! you'll learn a ton.", "[0.25] [Winter 2017] If you want to make music, this class will not help you a ton. However, it is a good baseline. Everything is very introductory.", "[0.9] [Winter 2017] TAKE THIS CLASS! Easily my favorite class I've taken at Stanford so far. Even if you have a very minimal interest in music production you can take away so many lessons and will find something to be curious about for so much time after the last class. If you take this, know that it will be so much fun but you get out of it what you put in. You can coast by and still get a good grade but this class isn't about that so I would highly suggest putting as much time as possible into your projects and into actual learning.", "[0.4] [Winter 2017] This course is halfway between electronic music history and electronic music production.  If that's what you're looking for, then this course is for you. However, if you're looking for something very hands-on (production-based), this course may be too focused on history.", "[0.75] [Winter 2017] Very helpful if you would like to learn how to create sounds and electronic music.", "[0.9] [Winter 2017] definitely take it! it opens your eyes to such much, and you learn valuable information that is difficult to acquire on your own. if you love music and want to learn to create your own, take this!", "[0.8] [Winter 2017] Absolutely take it. It has been my favorite class at Stanford so far. The instructors are actually invested in the class, and it is a great way to learn more about another dimension of music. It also gives you the tools for production in a really concise and practical way.", "[0.7] [Winter 2017] Good intro, will continue to improve as they work out some of the kinks in the system", "[0.0] [Winter 2017] Take it!!!!!", "[0.95] [Winter 2017] harder than you think it's going to be (mostly the computer/software sides of things but also some of the concepts!) but there's lots and lots of support so take advantage ! it's really so cool and fun", "[1.0] [Winter 2017] Definitely take it! If you need an excuse to learn techniques and music production or a certain type of software, this class is great. You get out of it what you put in to it. But the professors and TAs are so passionate and enthusiastic and there to help you grow to the degree you want to improve.", "[0.85] [Winter 2017] You don't spend a ton of time making music except for the final project. But you do learn important skills to doing so. More busy work than I would like but hopefully they change that in later iterations.", "[0.0] [Winter 2017] Ask lots of questions and go to office hours.", "[0.55] [Winter 2017] Do it if you want to be making music. Even if it's not electronic music, it's valuable to know mixing techniques and such.", "[0.95] [Winter 2017] Cool experience. Gave space to explore something I've always wanted. It's a bit heavy on analog tech for me - I couldn't always translate it to digital technology. But it was fun and the instructors/TAs were so so so great and accommodating.", "[0.6] [Winter 2017] great class, learn how to produce music", "[0.9] [Winter 2017] This is a great introductory class to audio production and making electronic music. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got a great mix of theory and hands on experience.  I loved working closely with the instructors and TA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and the time and dedication they gave to all the students was incredible.", "[0.85] [Winter 2017] I can sense that the instructor put a fair amount of effort into this new course, However, most lecture are just reading from Wikipedia page without any more in detail explanation, most of time I dont' even understand the word on the slide. But this is not important, because what is taught in slides has nothing to do with homework. I came this class aiming to learn some practical skills in making music tracks (like how to add bass lines, how to add drum patterns, like really \"HOW\") but most homework are just so elementary that it barely teaches you anything. However, the instructor aritificially add workload by assigning useless readings, I feel like most of the reading/listening assignments are just a waste of time. I am not interested in those outdated, archived articles about some unknown sound artist. If I want to know about sound art history, there should be another class solely purposed for that like an art history class. I understand reading a little history can be fun for this class, but this is not the main reason I took this class. I was hoping to learn more about music arrangement, But I learnt nothing from this class. Eventually, I end up learning a ton from youtube videos, which is very ironic."], "MUSIC 103": ["[1.0] [Spring 2022] Low intensity, fun 1-unit course going to about 3 concerts from different genres over the quarter and talking about them, as well as thinking about the experience of listening. I enjoyed the listening guide exercise, where you share one piece you enjoy with classmates, along with a short description of why you like it; it was cool seeing why other people enjoy music from different styles. Kirstin and Gabriel are wonderfully compassionate, thoughtful instructors who ask questions that expand the class discussion. My main critique would be that there was not much sense of community built within the class, even though it was a small group, because we only met once every other week on average, and during those meetings people often just stuck together with the small subset of people they already knew. It might have been nice if the listening guide exercise was in person, for instance, during a class meeting instead of just commenting on each other's google docs.", "[0.6] [Spring 2022] This class was great because you got to go to a lot of concerts.", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] very cool class if you enjoy attending concerts! this class will help expand your music taste and teach you more about how to listen more actively to music!", "[0.65] [Spring 2022] Awesome class! You get a unit to listen to music. If you're in to that, do it.", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] This class is so fun! It's also a very chill 1 unit. All you do is attend concerts and then discuss them afterwards, and I actually learned a lot about the music listening experience that I will take with me to future concerts. Gabriel and Kirstin are so nice and accommodating, and overall it is a great course.", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] This class is super low commitment and you get to go to a few concerts for free, so you should definitely consider taking it if you just want an extra unit on your transcript. Not every concert will be your favorite, but I think there should be at least one that you really enjoy. For me, that was Frost Fest.", "[0.8] [Spring 2022] super fun", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] I really liked this class! The assignments and discussions were interesting and I looked forward to having this class to listen and talk about music after a long day. I took it virtually, so all of the concert experiences were livestreams, but I imagine that during a normal school year this aspect would have really enjoyable as well.", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] A very fun, interesting, and low commitment class.

In my year, we attended Madama Butterfly with no trigger warnings or discussion beforehand, and it was a jarring experience. With that said, I learned a lot about the world and art in general. I'm happy that I took this class, had these experiences engaging with art (and asking important questions about art -- what does it mean to make art? what makes one an artist? what is art?), and met the people in the class. Super cool cohort of diverse, artistic, radically awesome people. I grew a lot and have a more holistic understanding of the world because I went on this trip and met these people. I will say that the spring quarter class is very lax and you can pretty much choose whatever you want for the midterm and final project, which I greatly appreciated.", "[0.85] [Spring 2022] It was okay - the New York trip was amazing and possibly the best part of my Stanford experience. However, the class seemed unnecessary at times. There was no reason for classes to be 3 hours long", "[0.85] [Spring 2019] It&#x2019;s a great introsem.

Definitely apply if you think you might like art or New York or both!", "[0.65] [Spring 2019] The New York trip was awesome! The class itself was based on presentations and Q and A, so if you go into it with an open mind, you will get more out of it.", "[0.6] [Spring 2019] I would recommend this, it was an immersive experience that few get to experience, and NY is undeniably fun and wondrous. But keep in mind that you might be thrown off by what kind of art you experience, depending on the program that year. I for sure didnt expect such a heavy focus on fine art and theater'; though I knew it would make sense given we were in NYC, with the Opera HOuse and whatnot at our fingertips, I maybe would have considered the LA trip more if I had known we'd be focusing so heavily on theater (which isn't an interest of mine)", "[0.65] [Spring 2019] NYC schedule is jam-packed each day. You really get to experience all NYC has to offer, though you will be beat by the end of the week! Fun trip but the class during Spring Quarter is a joke.", "[0.9] [Spring 2019] The trip to NYC is extremely fun and eye-opening. It will teach you to appreciate Art of various forms (if you didn't already). It would have been much more enjoyable if the teaching staff were able to connect with the students and try to understand our perspective instead of subtly pushing us to conform to the popular opinion.", "[0.7] [Spring 2019] It&#x2019;s a pretty chill class and provides you the opportunity to explore new topics of art after the New York trip.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] Highly recommend!

Overall, I wish we covered actual composition techniques, since I don't feel like I learned that much in terms of composition (I came in with a lot of experience compared to the rest of the class, so I generally fared fine). It was helpful learning about the preparation scene and organizational skills behind film scoring, though. I would only recommend this class if you're really interested in film scoring, and even then, the quality of instruction is only okay, nothing spectacular.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] Marco was an awesome instructor and this was definitely the best class I've taken at Stanford so far!

Absolutely take this class if you can!", "[0.85] [Spring 2022] This is my favorite class I have taken at Stanford ever. Professor D'Ambrosio is incredible and so knowledgable. He truly wants to help you learn and become a better composer. Be warned that knowledge of using a DAW and digital workspace is definitely necessary it can be difficult if you don't have prior experience.", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] I really enjoyed this course! Lecture is mostly about film and film music history, with techniques for orchestration and scoring mixed in. The professor talks about his own experiences and compositions a lot, which was helpful to understand how things work in real film productions. Would recommend some music making experience, especially electronic music, and a fair amount of patience for yourself if not. It's a you-get-out-what-you-put-in type of course - you can spend a lot of time on your assignments or take it chill.", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] Super interesting class. It's a pretty niche musical area though so only pursue if you are genuinely interested in the field.", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] Really great! Lots of freedom to explore your own style of composing!", "[0.75] [Spring 2022] This is a great course for someone who already has some experience with composing and writing for picture. I felt like there was a steep learning curve up front because I practically had no film experience. We spent a lot of time on history (undoubtedly important), but not a lot of time on the nuts and bolts of how to actually compose for film (e.g. what chord patterns work? what instruments are good?). So, the expectation is that you are a solid composer coming in.", "[1.0] [Spring 2020] Disclaimer: I took this class online, so I cannot speak for the in-person experience.  I found that the weekly films and the analysis paper sharpened my ability to both spot film scoring techniques and apply them to my own work for the final project.  Professor Wineglass is a very friendly and knowledgeable instructor--be sure to seek out his feedback often and early for your final project.  Also, you should have some degree of prior experience in writing music and be very comfortable with the process of writing/exporting in a DAW.  You are given lots of flexibility for the final scene scoring project, so be sure to play to your strengths and select a good scene!  I really enjoyed this class, but I would have liked a little more practical instruction on the process of film scoring.  After learning the basics, you are mostly cut loose to work on your project.  In retrospect, having more lecture material to mull over before jumping right in might have been nice.  I would definitely recommend this course for anyone interested in improving their composition skills!", "[0.5] [Spring 2020] Wish I could have taken it in person!!", "[0.8] [Spring 2020] This class would be great for music-lovers who have very little experience performing, writing, and analyzing. The entire course orients around examples of Gorbman's principles as well as diegetic/non-diegetic music (both source and original). The class provides a very broad understanding of film scoring.", "[-0.4] [Spring 2020] i honestly don't know how much i got out of this course. i took it because it seemed like a such a niche/cool thing to learn, being a composition student already. while part of this could be attributed to taking this online, we had maybe 1/2 lectures where we learned about techniques of film scoring. the rest was spent analyzing movies, which was helpful but did not help me synthesize my own music. i did not know how to approach my final project at all, and am not proud of the result.", "[0.45] [Spring 2020] It's good to know the history of film music", "[1.0] [Spring 2020] I'm not sure what this class is like when it's offered in person, but if it's offered online I strongly recommend you do not take it. The course description makes it seem like you'll be learning a lot of cool skills about how to write film music in a daw, and maybe even learn some practical music theory as it relates to film music, but we did not cover a single one of these topics even once. The professor only uploaded 5 lectures for the entire quarter, and none of them had very substantive material. Overall it was a super frustrating class because the professor is clearly a brilliant composer, but shared hardly anything in the lectures.", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] super cool course, the structure of the class is so awesome that it helps you think about your other music classes", "[0.8] [Spring 2020] Informative, comprehensive, and fun course on film music. You'll learn about the history of film music, develop a framework for how film music interacts with images and events on screen, watch and analyze several movies, write an analytical paper on the music of a film of your choosing, and finally set a pre-existing scene or visual to your own music for the final project. This course left me with a deeper understanding and appreciation for music in film, TV, and all other forms of audiovisual media."], "MUSIC 113": ["[0.95] [Autumn 2022] Be warned, the name and description of this class are misleading. You only learn how to compose specifically for saxophone quartet (not instruments in general) and you specifically learn about MODAL music, which is extremely different from conventional music that has chord progressions. Francois also gave one on one tutoring sessions in composition which was nice, but a large majority of the tips he gave me were about my sheet music notation, not my actual music. Focusing on notation instead of the sound of music seemed to be a theme of the course. On the bright side, I did learn what musical modes are to the point where I could choose to use one if I really wanted to. I also learned the idea of sentence vs period repetition structure, which has helped how I see the structure of every song. I also learned the ranges of saxophones and how their music is written. Also got better at composing for multiple instruments, but I wouldn\u2019t say that was because of the course, just a result of needing to write a 5 minute piece as a final project. Francois is a very energetic and kind teacher, but for me he seemed very disorganized and hard to follow. I LOVED how professional musicians performed our piece in a concert. It sounded really good and made me forget how much difficulty and frustration I had with the rest of the class.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] Francois is brilliant and an amazing composer and teacher, but this particular course isn't his most coherent. The first four composition assignments requires using very specific techniques like certain modes, mixed modes, pentatonic/octotonic scales etc. which are very academic and almost certainly won't make it into your final saxophone quartet. To me more frustratingly, we are introduced mostly to (admittedly very cool) pieces by Stravinsky and Bartok for solo piano, clarinet, or woodwind quintet, but notably we don't listen to any saxophone quartets! The first half of the course just isn't connected to the final half where you compose your own sax quartet, and I think this class would benefit from more treatment of the quartet form and writing for saxophone in general. Overall though, the I really enjoyed the course and learning from Francois -- and hearing your piece played at the end of the quarter by a live sax quartet was a very cool experience!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] It's a good course, but quite fast-paced, especially if a lot of the material is new to you. But the feeling of hearing your composition played at the end of the quarter is definitely worth it.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] This is one of my favorite classes, that I have ever taken at Stanford. Francoise Rose is one of the kindest, most passionate instructors that you will ever meet. He also gives wonderful feedback on how to improve your pieces, and he is very eager to help. He definitely contributed a lot of great ideas that elevated my work. However, you should be warned that this class is not really an introductory class for those who have no clue what instrumental composition is, and maybe just want to try it out. After all, you do have to write a 5 minute sax quartet piece, which definitely did not feel like the task of a beginner. It is more of an introductory class for those who already have some experience with writing or playing music. Also, for me at least, this course was more of a 4-5 unit course. Because it generally takes me a long time to write, I would spend a lot of time on the homework each week.\nThis class can be frustrating as it requires you to push yourself as a composer. At the same time, the difficulty of this class is what makes it so rewarding. There is nothing more rewarding then listening to something you made that you are proud of. Overall, I LOVED this class because it affirmed to me why I love songwriting and why it is I pursue it.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] I would say, at best, this course is a good way to get a taste of the composition department at Stanford.\nI enjoyed the fact that all our homework was simply to compose music.\nOn the other hand, I did not enjoy the fact that our assignment seemed to be measured to a specifically classical standard that discouraged me from experimenting and trying sounds that I personally enjoyed better. I felt that our professor was constantly steering not towards music that was necessarily \"better\", rather more in line with his personal tastes.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] I loved this class! It was simultaneously my hardest and funnest class, since it feels a bit like you have no idea what you're doing the whole time while you compose and explore your style. Francois is great, and he makes sure you're on the right track and gives you just enough support to get you to the end. Some of the classes weren't very helpful for the project, but still interesting.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2021] This is the most incredible music class you can take, especially for a non-music majors. Francois is an amazing, charismatic, and funny instructor. The class is the opposite definition of boring. The first five weeks covers the music theory for composition, many focuses on modality. These lessons are fun, comprehensive, and intensive. The last five weeks are focused on individual composition project. At the end of the quarter, professional musicians come in to play your piece in a spectacular concert. Composing my own music is, by far, the most challenging single thing I have ever done at Stanford, but it is also the most fulfilling as well. I spend so much time on only 5 minutes of a saxophone quartet, but the musicians play it so well that all the bucketful of sweat and tears shed during the process was well worth it. After the dust settles, you emerges as a composer who creates. I am completely inspired to pursue more composition work in the future, especially if it is taught by Francois Rose.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2021] I won't lie. This course caused me an incredible amount of stress and anxiety throughout this quarter, and writing the saxophone quartet was probably the most difficult project I have ever done in my life. But it was SO WORTH IT and I highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in music composition. It is so satisfying to not know anything about composing, and then in 10 weeks have professional musicians playing a piece you composed at a concert. Francois is incredible and probably the kindest professor I have had so far at Stanford. He brings so much energy to the class and is so encouraging even when things get really tough with your composition. And they will get tough. But you'll leave this class with everything you need to be a good composer, and a deep appreciation for the composition process. However, make sure you take the class for 3 units, because it ends up being closer to 4 units, and you want to make sure you get those units accounted for.", "[-0.6] [Autumn 2021] This is difficult course- writing a sax quartet can be difficult", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] If you are a beginner to composition, this is definitely a very good class to start in. I took it for fun, but it ended up being the class I most diligently worked in this quarter. Professor Francois is a very enthusiastic instructor and inspires you to work hard. I do not ever want to disappoint him.", "[-0.1] [Autumn 2021] It may be helpful to include in the course description that some prior music theory knowledge will enhance a student's learning experience. As a student with little advanced music theory knowledge, I often experienced difficulty composing for the assignments. Especially for the final sax quartet project, I had difficulty understanding the limitations of the saxophone and composing a whole 5-6 minute piece from scratch.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2021] This is a great course if you're looking to dabble in composition.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] It's a great course! I came in with basically no knowledge of composing, and a very limited background in theory, but was able to learn a lot in a rather short amount of time. The composing assignments are a lot of fun, and it's an amazing experience to hear a piece you've composed live. Prof. Rose is also incredibly encouraging and knowledgeable!", "[0.55] [Autumn 2019] I would recommend this course, but make sure you have a moderate prior knowledge of music theory.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2019] its great", "[1.0] [Autumn 2019] This course was wonderful. Francois is a splendid teacher and explained all the concepts well. I have two comments, however. The first is that the level of technical music knowledge should be defined more clearly as a prerequisite. I felt like there was a wide range of ability in the class, and so some people struggled more with the concepts than others. The other comment is that please, PLEASE, for the love of all that is holy, PLEASE do not have students compose sax quartets. Almost everyone in the class was unfamiliar with how a sax quartet works and the technical restrictions of saxophones. Aspects like limited range and breathing patterns made composing an extraordinary challenge. Even something simpler, like a piano and violin duet would be enough to suffice for beginning composers. I say this as well because many people in the class were disappointed with how their compositions were played at the recital. While not the fault of the musicians, I think the mix of not enough rehearsal time and the students not being prior acquainted with saxophones made the experience very disheartening. These are compositions that people spent many hours on and there were at least two repeats in every single person's piece by the musicians. Perhaps more restrictions or lectures about the quartet would make sure this is not a problem in the future.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2019] best composition class to take", "[1.0] [Autumn 2019] This course is amazing and Francois is the absolute best, but this class is a definite time commitment! You could probably do the bare minimum for each assignment and that would be fine, but at least for me, composition is one of those things it feels bad to not put effort in. The amount of effort it takes to go from \"bare minimum\" to \"actually sounds nice, kinda proud of this\" is a lot, so its up to you what you want to put in. Besides that, this is a super high-value and fun class!! You get to compose for a real saxophone quartet and hear your piece in a concert at the end! Francois is truly the nicest and most excited person you will ever meet. I would really really recommend this class, just treat it like a 4-unit class and make sure you have the time to make the most of it :)", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Great class if you're interested in composing music! It's a class where you definitely get as much as you put into it since it's very project based and half of the class is you composing your own piece. Francois is an amazing human and professor and will give you good tips on your writing and will just always make you smile :)", "[0.65] [Autumn 2019] The final project where professional musicians play your composition is awesome. Generally a fun course, but come with some knowledge of music.", "[0.75] [Winter 2019] It's fun! Professor Rose is really chill and challenges you to venture out of your musical comfort zone.", "[0.5] [Winter 2019] It's a good way to spend time composing! I think something that might have helped was having the exercises be more correlated to what we learned.", "[0.75] [Winter 2019] An amazing and unique opportunity", "[0.0] [Winter 2018] Don't start the composition the night before it's due!", "[0.9] [Winter 2018] Go for it! It's an amazing introduction to composition; it really affirmed my interest in composition and has encourage me to pursue it more.", "[0.8] [Winter 2018] If you love music, take this! Regardless of your skill level/experience. Most of the class had no theory background and no composition experience, so PLEAEPLEASEPLEASE don't be intimidated. If you would like to learn how to create art with intention and forethought, take this class.", "[0.8] [Winter 2018] Great class. My favorite class so far.", "[1.0] [Winter 2018] The pre-requisites for this course are misleading. On the first day of class he pretty much says you need to know major and minor scales, and meter. You do... but you need to know a lot more. Between the first week and the last week you'll go from writing 8 measure melodies to a full movement of a quartet, but if you feel like you don't have the technical skills to compose a quartet at this very moment do NOT take this class. Those skills will not be taught, and while you will get practice with them throughout the quarter it is only because they will be expected and required. It is possible to get by without them, but you will have to do a LOT of theory learning on your own and this class suddenly becomes more than 2 units. This class does not teach you \"how\" to make an instrumental composition, but rather it encourages you to compose and gives stylistic suggestions. If you want to push yourself a lot and force yourself to learn the theory, or you already have the theory knowledge, go ahead and take it. I would say that if you've never taken theory, unless you have a very strong musical background, this class is going to be WAY more work than expected. If you've taken one theory class then it will definitely still be challenging but a lot more doable. If you've taken more than one theory class, you'll probably be fine from a technical standpoint, and can focus on the creative part alone. With that being said, Francois is a great guy who will pick apart your compositions and tell you how he thinks you can improve and your final project is played by actual players at a recital, so that's super cool.", "[1.0] [Winter 2018] This is a wonderful class to take if you want to learn how to compose music. All the exercises, including the final project, really give you the opportunity to be creative and expressive, and Dr. Rose is such a fun teacher! He clearly enjoys working with students, provides clear and helpful feedback on all assignments, and presents lots of interesting and relevant music at every lecture.", "[0.65] [Winter 2018] Awesome intro class to composition!"], "MUSIC 113P": [], "MUSIC 115": [], "MUSIC 118": ["[0.95] [Autumn 2018] Definitely take this course. It will open you up to so many new ideas and is a great way to learn about CSRE through music. Dr. Gill is an amazing professor who is super enthusiastic about her work and will always make the class exciting.", "[0.35] [Autumn 2018] Do the readings. This class is as engaging as you make it.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2018] I would absolutely take, Dr. G will turn your world upside down (in a good way of course)", "[0.8] [Autumn 2018] This is one of the best courses I've taken here at Stanford. The title does not do a good job of describing how much the class will actually discuss music and social issues surrounding it. Dr. G is one of the most knowledgeable and enjoyable professors I've ever met. If you do the readings and put effort into the essays, you'dd do well.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] This course has been one of my favorite classes ever taken at Stanford. Every lecture is a compelling journey throughout numerous case studies that truly challenge your perception and understanding of appropriation, right and wrong, and the extent of how powerful and meaningful musics are and can be for people and societies. The instructors truly pushed me to interrogate myself and my listening and music-making practices in a way that I have never had to seriously think about before, and that is something incredibly valuable that you don't get very many opportunities or spaces to do in your lifetime.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2018] great course open your mind up", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] Awesome class. Dr. Gill is a great and enthusiastic lecturer. Super interesting and not too much work. You go over a lot of really cool case studies."], "MUSIC 12A": ["[0.0] [Autumn 2022] Take it!!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] This is a wonderful course that serves as a great introduction to piano, and Professor Zerlang is a fantastic instructor. Take it!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] If you are slightly interested, take it! Timothy is an absolute delight! I love his teaching, and I think he loves teaching as well.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] Take this class! It provides a good intro to piano. Dr. Zerlang is super nice and funny, plus the class is structured very well. You don't need previous musical experience which is also nice.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2022] A great course, it will take time and effort.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] This class is so fun. You'll learn piano from the very basics including how to read music. Zerlang is one of the best and most likable professors here and he is full of fun insights about music theory and history.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2022] Take it. It\u2019s amazing and Professor Zerlang is fantastic.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] A great class by a great instructor. You will not only learn to play the piano, but also facts about music history that Tim often mentions during lectures. If you are interested in music, give it a shot.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2022] Fun class and forces you to make time for something other than school work. The homework can pile up thought if you leave it for too long so make sure to keep up to date!", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] Zerlang is the best! Really looked forward to class every week. Week 1 takes up the full 3 hours as there are a ton of people that will eventually drop, you have to get enrollment codes, etc. After that, we were rarely there for more than an hour. If you have an iPad, get the Kindle version of the book; the binding of the one you get from the bookstore makes it impossible to stand open on its own. No piano playing in class. He introduces the new concepts and material but all of the work happens on your own. Assignments are submitted via video and can take a bit of time. Make sure you can play for an hour a day if you really want to improve. Fun thing though is that the videos provide really good documentation of your progress.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2022] The professor is awesome! The class was the high point of my week. If you don't know how to read music and how to get yourself around the piano, this class is for you. However, I have to mention that it is far from being a 1-unit class. You will have homework every single week, and it takes a bunch of time to complete, especially the first ones.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] Professor Zerlang is a funny and knowledgeable instructor. He explains things in a way that is very simple and easy to understand. Definitely take it!", "[0.2] [Autumn 2022] Relies a lot on practicing outside of the course, even if you only meet once a week. The instruction goes very fast as well, so some concepts were a little confusing and weren't reviewed unless you asked a question about it.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2022] I knew how to play another instrument already so the content during lectures was a lot of review but I wasn't that bored since Professor Zerlang's lecturing is engaging. In the beginning weeks the homework was fairly light since I had music background but as the quarter progressed the homeworks took longer to record (about three to five hours a week), so keep that in mind when allocating your time.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] Its a great class\u2013\u2013 although if you are hoping to start piano from scratch, be aware the workload will be much more than 1 unit; Outside of class I was playing for some 10 hours a week in order to do well on the homework", "[0.7] [Winter 2022] Its a great class for learning piano, just don't take if you are already taking heavy classes because its time consuming to get through playing the homework pieces especially if you are a complete beginner", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] it's quite a lot of work. it feels more like a 3 unit class than a one unit class. definitely take it if you have experience and are really interested but it's very easy to procrastinate piano practice and assignments.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] If you are interested in learning to play piano, this is the place to start. Tim knows his stuff and is eager to help you learn piano. If you have a music background, most points in lectures will definitely seem redundant, but both Tim's awesome style of teaching and the act of learning piano makes up for it. If you have no music background, this is definitely the place to start and has a really in depth yet soft/comfortable intro to music fundamentals.", "[0.65] [Winter 2022] Timothy Zerlang is a wonderful professor! In addition to doing a fine job at teaching piano techniques and musical literacy, he has such a funny and playful personality, which I looked forward to each class. He is very understanding and willing to work with you regarding your assignments, but be warned, the weekly assignments do take quite some time to complete if you are not very adept at sightreading and playing (which happens to be most 12A students).", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] This class is not a very intimate introduction to piano, but it at the very least gives you a little extra pressure to practice. I definitely improved, but there's very little substance to the actual teaching as it's done as a group. You can probably skip this one if you have any rudimentary music experience and some self-driven motivation to practice.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Although yes its 1 unit, there is still work expected from you! The class might move a little fast for people who are new at reading music and such but it is so worth it after some dedication to the keys. Don't regret taking this class at all. Great stuff.", "[0.0] [Winter 2022] You have to be consistent in practicing to get the most out of this class.", "[0.55] [Winter 2022] I'm bummed this class costs additional tuition, because it is no different from a normal lecture-based class. The only non-standard value it adds is having access to the music practice rooms, which is a much smaller $50 per quarter otherwise. In a normal class, we would walk in to the classroom and each sit down at an electric piano, and then Timothy would go around to each of us asking how we are doing and having a small conversation about our weekend/week, which was pleasant, but that took up about 30% of class time because he would then lecture for no more than an hour (it got down to about 30 minutes by the end of the quarter), and we would leave without having played the piano in class at all. The one thing this class provided me was motivation to practice every week and a good set of short pieces to practice. I think in the future I will just use the textbook on my own time.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Amazing Class !!! Timothy is literally one of my favorite instructors at Stanford. I love how he always asks us how we're doing at the beginning of the class and checks whether we have any questions about the previous homework or his comments. He is also really funny and explains all the concepts very clearly.", "[0.25] [Winter 2022] Though class is 1 unit, be prepared to practice alot. The pieces get progressively harder as the quarter unfolds.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] I would highly recommend the course to anyone interested in learning how to play the piano. I would just keep in mind that the course does teach lots of content and takes more time than a regular 1 unit class would (for a beginner pianist). I would consider this to be more like a 2 or 3 unit class due to the practice time it takes.", "[0.4] [Winter 2022] I would say you really need to devote at least 30 minutes a day practicing what you learned in class", "[0.7] [Winter 2022] This is a cool class to take, however, if this is truly your first time playing piano it will not be a one unit course. This class takes between ten to twelve hours to do the homework, which is not great when you have planned to take a one unit course for fun.", "[0.7] [Winter 2022] Great class if you're like me and have always wanted to play piano, but thought the task was too daunting! I never thought I'd be reading sheet music, talking about major and minor scales, and doing chord inversions after just 10 weeks!", "[0.35] [Winter 2022] I came into this class with a strong knowledge of music but no piano experience. I was surprised at how much it challenged me. I grew a lot, but I think that it gets especially difficult near the end of the quarter. Be ready to commit up to ten hours a week near the end of the quarter.", "[0.7] [Winter 2022] This is a great introduction to the piano. Professor Zerlang is very light hearted and engaging, and he starts from the very beginning and goes very slowly, ensuring that every student is in the same place and understands why notation developed the way it did. The assignments directly reflect what he talks about in class, and he does not waste time in class that does not need to be wasted - he understands that sometimes going into too much depth and explaining the concepts too thoroughly can actually confuse beginner students more.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] I loved this class, and for someone with 0 piano experience it was a lot of content and skills. However homeworks are really intense and long especially if you have bad hand coordination like me, so be ready to allocate 4-5 hours per homework, which are every week. But it was definitely enjoyable and pleasant when everything would work out.", "[0.65] [Spring 2022] Very good introduction to piano and music in general. I came in knowing a lot of music theory from other experiences other than piano, but many of my classmates had none whatsoever. The content was engaging for all of us.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] Tim is SO FUNNY & a pleasure to have class with. The course assumes that you've never even heard music in your life & teaches you how to do everything from the ground up. You have to record yourself playing the piano for homework, and he will give feedback each week. Class sessions would usually end early so we have time to go play. It's a must take if you're interested in piano!!", "[0.0] [Spring 2022] A bit of a grind - HWs can be a lot!", "[0.85] [Spring 2022] Really fun, and I love Timothy. But as someone who has never touched an instrument, it showed in my grade. He grades based on how well you play the pieces (rhythm, correct notes, etc).", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] Great class for beginners. Moves a little fast though, and most students aren't actually beginners and are way more advanced than people with no experience. If you have no experience the homework assignments take surprisingly long. Once you start getting the hang of it, it becomes easier and more fun. Doing the homework became the highlight of my week academically.", "[0.35] [Spring 2022] Great class but too many assignments", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] Y'all, this course is actually so awesome, and it's free! Tim is one of the coolest teachers I've ever had. He's just so funny, interactive, and understanding that it's hard not to enjoy the course. He is also pretty clear in explaining musical topics and techniques on piano in different ways. He's also very open to questions which is great! I always looked forward to piano class.\n\nMy one comment/criticism is that this class is advertised as 1 unit, but it actually takes much more time than you expect, especially as you get further into the class. It's still completely doable! Just don't let yourself get behind on assignments, and save 3 hours at least every week for practice and recording the assignments.\nDO NOT GET BEHIND!", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] Prof. Zerlang is a great instructor - kind, patient, and energetic, which is just what is needed for a beginner-level class. The homeworks certainly ramp up in intensity, but they're still manageable, and you can see your progress throughout the quarter. Definitely recommend this class!", "[0.65] [Autumn 2021] Take this class!! Practice assignments for homework can usually be finished in 2-3 sessions at the piano for an hour or so. Zerlang is a fantastic teacher and teaches piano in a way that makes soo much sense. Should be a two unit class, but that won't stop me from taking the next.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] I would 100% recommend this course to students who have an interest in learning piano although I do understand that having to pay a fee hinders lots of students. I would also sing the praises of Timothy Zerlang. He is incredibly talented and extremely funny. He is also super flexible when it comes to extensions.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2021] This class is fantastic and SO engaging but very time consuming. We learned so much and progressed quickly. Dr. Zerlang is terrific: fun, funny, knowledgable, and an unbelievably wonderful piano player. He is flexible with deadlines and highly understanding. However, I took the class in a quarter in which I had more flexibility/time but do not think I could have taken this class had I been in a heavy 18 or 20 unit quarter. Take this class if you're really interested in learning the basics of piano!", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] It's a very fun class! I highly recommend if you're new to the piano and want to learn more.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2021] I found this course to be very fulfilling for me because I always wanted to learn how to play an instrument. This class was a great spot to start.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2021] I would take this class. A fun instructor who really knows what he is doing and who you should trust.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2021] Definitely take this course if you're interested in relearning or learning the basics for the first time!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] I would highly recommend it! If you never learned piano, or even any music before, this class is easy and fun to pick up.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] Dr. Z is great. It's a good deal of work if you're like me and really have no musical experience or aptitude, but he makes it engaging and worthwhile.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] This has got to be one of the best classes I've ever taken at Stanford. Easily the most fun! Dr. Zerlang is not just an incredible instructor, but a really great and funny person to be around. If you take this class, you'll definitely be taking 12B... it's that good! No need to know anything about music before taking this class. Low stress. Thank you Dr. Zerlang for teaching me a lifelong hobby! In short, take this class!!", "[-0.05] [Autumn 2021] Sometimes the homework pieces will be hard. It will sometime take many tries to complete a piece but that is ok.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2021] If you want to learn piano, this class will help you make a huge leap forward", "[0.55] [Autumn 2021] It's a fun class, though very self-directed. If you have some familiarity with music theory or you played in band or orchestra in high school, a lot of it will be review. Homework can actually take a while (more than expected for a 1-unit class), so keep that in mind. Pieces always felt challenging. The lessons are with a group, so don't expect useful and individualized feedback.", "[0.2] [Autumn 2021] good if you have no prior experience", "[0.5] [Autumn 2021] beginner friendly", "[0.95] [Summer 2021] Professor Zerlang is so kind and wants to se you learn and improve. It was harder to get personalized feedback in the online format, but I am sure that will be much better in person. I definitely feel that you learn so much in 10 weeks about playing piano, and I feel much more confident looking at piano sheet music and knowing how to start it.", "[0.95] [Summer 2021] Really enjoyed this course and feel like I learned piano!! Thanks so much for a great class!!!", "[0.9] [Summer 2021] Prof Zerlang is wonderful and approachable -- as a complete beginner, I really appreciated this and loved taking this course under him!", "[0.0] [Winter 2021] decent ways fulfillment", "[0.8] [Autumn 2020] I would recommend taking this course if you are looking for an intro to the piano. Although, do keep in mind that you will need to dedicate time each day to practice. You will definitely need patience, but it is extremely rewarding by the end of the course.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2020] Homework may take longer than expected, especially if you have never touched a piano.", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] Professor Zerlang is an engaging, patient, and thoughtful instructor. He creates an environment where students are encouraged to ask questions, don't feel pressured to perform, and have fun learning! No previous music experience necessary and the workload is reasonable. Really enjoyed the class!", "[0.55] [Autumn 2019] Don't be afraid if you have never played any instrument! Tim is meeker and more humor than any teacher I know. Absolutely no stress in his class", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] If you have no musical background and want to learn piano this is probably a good class for you. As someone who's played another instrument and already knows music, this class was pretty slow at times because class meetings go over concepts like eighth notes, reading music, etc. The group format of the class also isn't great for getting any sort of individual instruction on technique / musicality. That being said, the class is pretty fun and Prof. Zerlang / Tim is a good instructor and pretty funny.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] This class is a lot of fun. I really enjoyed it and learned more than I thought I would. The professor is super nice and really easygoing about attending different sections or leaving early. This a class where you really get out what you put in. Don't expect to learn that much just by going to class, you really need to practice as consistently as possible. I found it a really nice break from my work to practice a little everyday. I would definitely recommend taking this course if you have time!", "[0.45] [Autumn 2019] This is a good introductory piano class, it only asks for how much you're willing to give it.", "[-0.2] [Autumn 2019] Its well taught but can be stressful if you don't put the time into learning the assignments since you have to play them in class as a group.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2019] It's a great course", "[0.3] [Autumn 2019] make sure to practice as much as possible and preferably every day", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] The instructor is really great and fun! He is a good teacher and creates a fun learning environment. This course is challenging if you've never played an instrument but you can definitely get through it", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] Tim is wonderful (and sassy, we love you, Tim)! It's a lot of fun if you are wanting to learn piano and know literally nothing about music. You get out what you put in, so if you don't practice it will only get harder the further you get. If you learn all the pieces for the week reasonably well, you'll be fine. I couldn't locate middle C on a piano at the beginning of the class but I am playing reasonably difficult pieces for two months of playing now! 12/10 would recommend.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] If you want to learn the piano, TAKE IT! Professor Zerlang always kept the class fun and lively and it was a fun atmosphere to play and learn in. The workload is quite high for a 1 unit class but nobody said learning an instrument was easy. Great class!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] This class is a fun way to get credits and the teacher is fun and easy to understand", "[0.8] [Autumn 2019] It's a very good class, it's very manageable and  Zerlang is a great instructor.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] This course provides a very solid basis of beginning piano playing, and the course is fun. Prof Zerlang has a great sense of humor.", "[0.75] [Spring 2019] It's a really great class and a lot of fun. However, if you have no experience with reading music or music theory, this class will probably be a lot of work for a 1-unit class. I spent about an hour a day practicing, which I found to be necessary to learn the material sufficiently.", "[0.25] [Spring 2019] Does require at least 30 minutes (or more) of playing a day to keep up. Very enriching if you can accommodate this.", "[0.9] [Spring 2019] This was so fun! It just adds something different to your week, coming in and hitting the practice room at the end of the day gave me such a good outlet and made the quarter much more varied. Also Timothy is great!", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] This class is an excellent introduction to both reading sheet music as well as how to play the piano. Timothy is an excellent instructor who makes the class incredibly fun and enjoyable while also teaching a lot about music and music theory. He really builds a relationship with his students which I appreciate. I would highly recommend this class!", "[0.7] [Spring 2019] If you want to learn how to play your first instrument this is your class. Be sure, though, to ensure you have time to practice because as someone who had never played an instrument it took a lot of extra practice time out of class (that I didn't really have).", "[0.5] [Spring 2019] Very good introduction to piano", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] Definitely take it! It's a great opportunity to learn piano quickly and in a low-stress environment.

I didn't know how to play the piano at all beforehand, and I was way more comfortable by the end of class.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] Definitely take this course! It is helpful to have some experience under your belt coming into the course but definitely not necessary. The professor is very kind and understanding of the learning process. He is also really funny.", "[0.85] [Spring 2019] Its an awesome course, a little time intensive for practice if you are new to music notation, but great.", "[0.3] [Winter 2019] be sure to practice consistently", "[0.65] [Winter 2019] Take it! it's a skill that goes on with you for life and Timothy is a great non-intimidating professor", "[0.25] [Winter 2019] Be sure you are ready to commit to practicing everyday. First two or three weeks you might think you want to, but when midterms hit and works ramps up, will you be motivated enough to stick with it? Some of the assigned music isn't that beautiful, so often there is not that much pleasure involved in practicing. You have to be determined for a higher goal", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] Good class if you want to learn how to play the piano. Timothy is hilarious and makes class fun. Really all about the amount of time you put in", "[0.6] [Winter 2019] Great course for someone without any background in piano. I needed lot of practice (3-4 hrs/week) to keep up.", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] It's awesome! It will be more work that you think, but the work is very enjoyable.", "[0.85] [Winter 2019] A great intro to piano. If you put in about 30 mins of practice a day, you'll see great results.", "[0.85] [Winter 2019] Best class. Professor is great!!", "[0.75] [Winter 2019] I have always wanted to learn how to play an instrument since I was very young but did not have the opportunity to do so. I am so grateful to have taken this course and to explore a new field I have never experienced before. Definitely take it with a light quarter so that you can focus on hand movements and sight readings for pieces of music.", "[0.3] [Winter 2019] You get what you put in. Make sure you take the time outside of the class to practice the skills that were taught.", "[-0.25] [Winter 2019] You must practice every week - I recommend you being practicing as soon as you learn the new material. It's very easy to fall behind and also very easy to fake your knowledge during class but in the end you don't gain anything, so practice everyday.", "[0.85] [Winter 2019] Great introductory course to begin learning the piano. Professor is supportive and is effectively able to teach multiple people at once.", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] Great class! Timothy is a great instructor with lots of energy and understanding of how to make students improve in a short amount of time.", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] Tim is a very engaging and wonderful instructor. If you put in the right amount of energy and commitment into the class, Tim reciprocate that positively.", "[0.65] [Winter 2019] Zerlang gives very fun lectures! Plan to practice a lot though!", "[0.6] [Winter 2019] A great introductory course", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] it is easy and relaxing at the beginning but will get harder. Definitely need some time to practice. But it is really fun. Certainly recommend it if you want to learn the basics of piano and/or seek a way to relax", "[0.85] [Winter 2019] I would highly recommend this course! I thought it moved at a fast enough speed to keep it challenging, but not too fast where it was overwhelming. Practice is definitely necessary as in any course, but Dr. Zerlang kept the course fun and minimizes the pressure of learning a new instrument.", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] Great class! Zerlang is nice and has a good sense of humor. The book is very organized and the pieces you learn to play are fun.", "[0.85] [Winter 2019] Excellent course with an amazing and funny professor. If you are clueless about piano this is the course to take.", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] I had so much fun in this class! Professor Zerlang is an incredibly talented and knowledgable music instructor. It was a pleasure to be in his class! I progressed more than I thought I would by taking this class being that we only meet once a week. Totally worth it and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to pick up the piano.", "[0.7] [Winter 2019] Very good for anyone who has never touched a piano before and is interested in learning", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] If you've always wanted to play piano, or improve on skills you learned in the past, then I highly encourage you to take this course. There's a fee, but I think the skills I learned have been worth the monetary expense. Zerlang is a great instructor, and I deeply appreciate all that I've learned from him.", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] If you want to learn piano without any background, this is the best fit for you.", "[0.7] [Winter 2019] Awesome!!", "[-0.65] [Autumn 2018] Piano is mostly practice, so what you get out of the class depends on what you put into it. Probably avoid if you have a busy quarter, because your piano practice might just fall by the wayside whenever things get stressful.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] This class is super fun. However, don't cram all of your practicing into one session. Timothy is great and has a wonderful sense of humor.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] Great class if you want to learn piano and you're willing to put in the time. Great instructor. Can pick up piano with 0 prior knowledge. Really astounding how fast you can learn an instrument with the structure of the course", "[0.75] [Autumn 2018] Definitely take it! I learned a ton and Timothy is really funny and knowledgeable.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] I'd take this if you're also in 19A, and treat it as sort of a lab section. Otherwise, take it if you want to learn piano. Tim is a great person and teacher. I'd highly recommend.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2018] Loved this course! Professor is wonderful but you actually have to put in the effort and practice during the week otherwise you won't be able to do well and keep up in class.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2018] Take it! It's a fun way to satisfy a way and you get to learn an instrument!", "[0.05] [Spring 2018] Prof. Zerlang is clearly a good musician and explains well the content, but he is not a good instructor. Speaks 90% of time and gives you a ton of homework.", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] This class is a lot of fun. The instructor is fun and is a great teacher. The class has a bunch of nice pianos!", "[0.9] [Spring 2018] DO IT! Timothy is excellent and learning the piano is so FUN!", "[0.7] [Spring 2018] Timothy is an extremely knowledgeable and engaging instructor!

Take it!", "[0.5] [Spring 2018] Make sure you have enough time to actually practice for a little every day. You don't have to play by yourself in front of everyone until your final performance and it's not as scary as it sounds!", "[0.75] [Spring 2018] This is a great introductory piano class. Timothy makes sure you understand the material before moving on.", "[0.8] [Spring 2018] don't do it unless u actually have the time and great passion to learn piano", "[0.1] [Spring 2018] Much more work than a 1 unit class would imply, but will get you on the right track if you want to learn piano.", "[0.0] [Spring 2018] lot of new material to practice every week", "[0.15] [Spring 2018] If you want to learn piano, take this class!", "[0.5] [Spring 2018] Take it. Fun and informative", "[0.45] [Spring 2018] this class is a good time", "[0.6] [Spring 2018] Practice! If you don't practice outside of class you won't learn much or get better at playing the piano", "[0.85] [Winter 2018] Really great course for a beginner who doesn't know anything about piano; Timothy is also a really great teacher", "[0.95] [Winter 2018] The class is great. The professor explains all the topics very clearly, and in an interesting and engaging way. He sparses interesting comments about musicians and music history while explaining the piano lesson. He really helps students feel confortable while playing the piano. Even though all of the students play the piano at the same time, the instructor is able to give a personalized attention to each of the students. I enjoyed the class a lot!", "[0.55] [Winter 2018] Perfect to learn piano basics", "[0.5] [Winter 2018] Nice introductory course!", "[0.0] [Winter 2018] Its more work than you expect in practice, which as the pieces get harder can tend towards an hour a day.", "[0.9] [Winter 2018] Great course and wonderful instructor. Make sure you have enough time to dedicate\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyou only get as much as you put in.", "[0.2] [Winter 2018] The class is very good, but it is a lot more than 1 unit's worth of work for someone who has never played an instrument before. I was practicing 30 minutes to an hour every day to be able to keep up", "[0.9] [Winter 2018] It's a fun course that teaches you quite a lot without assuming any starting knowledge. Definitely more work than one would expect from a one-unit course though. Would definitely recommend.", "[0.9] [Winter 2018] Great class! If you want to learn piano and basic music theory this is a great course. You will definitely achieve more than you think by the end if you put in the work.", "[0.95] [Winter 2018] I loved this class! I took it for fun and was not disappointed. Timothy is an excellent instructor and very funny! If you're considering and have the time, go for it.", "[0.85] [Winter 2018] Great class, Tim is great at teaching the material, practice a lot and you'll get the most out of it", "[0.6] [Winter 2018] Practice outside of class! It makes the experience so much more enjoyable and fulfilling.", "[0.95] [Winter 2018] BEST CLASS EVER!! Timothy Zerlang is the most amazing person you will ever meet. I loved this class so much.

Zerlang is an amazing person, and it feels amazing when, after practicing, you finally get a piece and it sounds like real music. This was one of my most fun classes all quarter, and a great escape from the more other, more stressful classes I was taking.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2017] If you ever wanted to learn piano, definitely take it.

He indeed is!", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] If you have no music background, be prepared to spend an unexpected amount of time on the homework but know that it is well worth the work.

CS!, HumBio!).", "[0.6] [Spring 2017] Do it, it's awesome and you'll learn a lot more than you'd expect.", "[0.7] [Spring 2017] Fun class, make sure you have enough time to practice!", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] Definitely make sure to practice.

Also, you will have to motivate yourself to practice, as this course only meets once a week.", "[0.85] [Spring 2017] This is a great course for those who have never played piano, or have not played in a long time. Timothy is a great teacher, and the class is all around very enjoyable.", "[0.9] [Spring 2017] Good course, requires more time than a 1 unit. Less useful if you know how to read music, but still a good way to improve your piano skills.

The class itself is mainly concerned with going over the homework assigned, and teaching a new skill.

I adored this class and the teaching style of the professor, and learned an incredible amount in a very short span of time. I recommend this class to anyone interested in learning the piano.", "[0.65] [Summer 2018] If you have absolutely no music experience, it may seem a bit scary at first, but it's still doable.

Incredible. And also helpful for those with some distant background.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2016] The professor is excellent and nice. The course is excellent too. If you practice as recommended you will be able to do all the assignments and might be excited for the following quarter. For me, it was fun and quite relaxing.", "[0.4] [Autumn 2016] I really like Tim's course and it really made my week. Will continue to take piano B.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2016] Its great! You learn how to play basic songs in piano. After this one class you can play very basic popular songs which is cool"], "MUSIC 12B": ["[0.9] [Autumn 2022] It's surprisingly harder than one might expect, but Professor Zerlang is amazing and you will improve a lot.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] Timothy is a fun and sociable teacher and makes the lessons engaging with fun facts about composers and music history. The pace moves relatively quickly but if you put in the practice it\u2019s very rewarding. I found that 3 hours a week (1 unit) is definitely on the low end. I spent a bit more than hour practicing each day, for 5 days a week, but I started at a fairly low level.", "[-0.35] [Autumn 2022] I was never able to complete each assignment in its entirety due to the fast pace and overwhelming amount of homework in this course.

Professor Zerlang is an absolute gem and you definitely need him in your life!", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] Timothy Zerlang is a very good instructor, you do not only learn how to play piano but also learn music theory and what happens in the back scene.

It was the highlight of my week to come to class. Try to practice a little everyday if you can. You get out of it what you put in", "[0.75] [Winter 2022] Dr. Zerlang is amazing! He is one of the kindest, funniest, and most skilled instructors I've had at Stanford. You definitely need to practice a lot more than 12A to master the material, but it is very much worth it. Cannot recommend this class enough!", "[0.8] [Spring 2022] Great professor, lot of work for a 1-unit class but worth it if you like practicing piano.", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] Big difficulty jump from 12a. Pieces are frustrating but rewarding.  Hand independence is a struggle. I've spent hours on some pieces. Take this class ideally when you don't have too much work. But also don't stress if you can't turn in your homework on time, Tim is understanding.", "[0.0] [Spring 2022] N/A", "[0.5] [Spring 2022] I would consider taking it for sure because while it is not as personalized as a private lesson, the professor gives personalized feedback on your playing and it forces you to practice on piano skills.", "[0.85] [Spring 2022] The course is fantastic, but it should be 2-3 units. The course is worth taking if you really want to continue to learn piano. However, it is a ton of time such that a lot of people ended up taking incompletes. Consider taking it for credit so that you do not need to submit all of the homeworks.", "[0.8] [Spring 2022] This class is structured similar to how it was on Zoom, so in class we mostly talk about music theory and most of the learning comes from you practicing on your own. As a result, you get out what you put into it. The class goes at a reasonable pace so it's not too hard to learn new pieces. It's super nice that the Music Department has now removed the $250 course fee.", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] Professor Zerlang is an excellent piano instructor who is a wealth of knowledge on piano skills and piano and music history itself. Lectures are highly enjoyable, and the result is an improvement of existing basic piano skills.

Definitely a step up from 12A, but still very doable and enjoyable.

He is the kindest, most available, funniest professor you'll ever have on stanford. If you want to learn the piano he's your guy!", "[0.75] [Summer 2021] This class is a great follow up to MUSIC 12A, but it is also significantly more difficult. Treat this more like a 3 unit class rather than a 1 unit class.", "[0.65] [Summer 2021] Take it! Professor Zerlang is an amazing instructor and you will learn so much!", "[0.8] [Winter 2021] Small class sizes and approachable lectures (even with little musical experience). Lots of time to ask questions about the repertoire and get feedback on your playing. The class and work are very fun and you can hear your progress weekly.", "[0.85] [Winter 2021] If you have taken Music 12A or haven't, this class is still great in terms of improving your playing skills as well as music theory knowledge for the average beginner.", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] This actually worked really well over Zoom if you can get your hands on a piano. The presentations used to teach us music theory were great, Timothy Zerlang is an awesome teacher, and sending in recordings forces you to practice. I'd take the next level of this course, even if over Zoom.", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] Presumably you've taken 12A, so you already know that Prof Zerlang both a fantastic teacher and person. The repertoire this quarter is by actual composers (Mozart, Beethoven) and sounds really good! Very satisfying to learn.", "[0.85] [Spring 2020] If you're interested in both music theory and playing the piano, this course is great!", "[0.8] [Spring 2020] Great course to continue to improve your piano skills.", "[0.6] [Spring 2020] amazing", "[1.0] [Autumn 2019] Definitely take this class if you want to improve at piano but don't want to pay for more expensive private lessons. When I took the class, there were only three or four students enrolled so we had ample opportunity to get feedback from professor Zerlang. The pace of the class is quite fast (you have to learn several new short pieces each week), but I felt like this was a fun challenge and much preferred this over the course going to slow and holding your hand. The professor is super nice and understands some weeks you may have less time to do the homework due to coursework or research. Again, great class and teacher!", "[0.75] [Spring 2019] A very fun class! Be ready to practice more than what Timothy asks for .", "[0.85] [Spring 2019] This course is tons of fun and you should definitely take it if you want to improve (or recover) your piano skills in a low-pressure environment.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] Tim is witty, fun, motivating, and an excellent instructor. Greatly improved my piano skills!", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] It's great! 12B starts at a level expecting you to read both clefs and play with hands together, but not more than that. Tim is a great teacher, and the assignments really help you grow as a player. A lot of practice is expected, definitely more time commitment than 1 unit.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] This is a great course! It's a lot of fun and Tim is an awesome instructor who cares about your improvement in piano, but also brings humor to class so you don't feel too much pressure playing with the rest of the class. Learning piano has helped me find some peace during the day and I am excited to continue playing.", "[0.8] [Spring 2019] Excellent class I highly recommend it to anybody. Even if you have 0 musical background Timothy is the right person to teach you music and piano!", "[0.85] [Spring 2019] I could not recommend lessons with Professor Zerlang any higher. This class was the best part of my Spring Quarter. You get so much better so quickly, the classes are fun and relatively low-stress, and Professor Zerlang is an incredible teacher. This has made me want to make piano a lifelong hobby.", "[0.65] [Winter 2019] Make sure you enjoy practicing piano.", "[0.6] [Winter 2019] Difficult but rewarding", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] Definitely a bigger time commitment than 12A.

But still a good course, Tim is still fun to be in class with and teaches the material well.", "[0.1] [Winter 2019] Don't miss class", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] It's definitely more than 1 unit of work if you want to do well, but Tim is a very understanding prof., and I'd highly encourage the class if it's something you're interested in learning.", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] Found it much harder than 12A, as more technical precision and keyboard skills are required. But Timothy does a great job introducing the intuition for the theory/new concepts, so would strongly recommend taking to solidify 12A skills.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] Fun class, but from what I heard, more challenging/serious than MUSIC 12A. Professor Zerlang is a hilarious person that makes each class very fun and engaging. He is understanding of mistakes but values hard work greatly.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] Absolutely fantastic course and I loved every moment of it. It does move rather quickly so a lot of practice outside if class is necessary to keep up with material.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2018] keep practice every day", "[-0.1] [Autumn 2018] This course is made much easier if one has an intermediate understanding of music theory beforehand; if you go into this class without thorough knowledge of both bass and treble clefs, you will struggle. And if, like me, you aren't used to playing an instrument with two hands, it becomes more difficult in that sense.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2018] Definitely take it if you want to get better in piano, but expect to spend a lot of time on practicing", "[0.8] [Spring 2018] It's chill but, like, Zerlang doesn't have terribly high standards, so it's what you make of it, really. Don't expect individual coaching, either. Just repertoire and scales to practice yourself.", "[0.45] [Spring 2018] Timothy is the best. This course is surprisingly serious but you get a lot out of it", "[0.9] [Spring 2018] I would highly recommend it! Professor Zerlang is an excellent instructor and combines practical skills with music theory and general knowledge to create an interesting, fulfilling learning experience.", "[0.9] [Spring 2018] The class is good, but it is really about how much effort you want to put in. At times it feels like more work than 1 unit, but it is rewarding.", "[0.6] [Spring 2018] You will learn a lot in this course. The pace of the class is fast. The instructor is excellent!", "[0.75] [Spring 2018] Its more work than 1 unit and practicing scales isn't very fun but its a helpful class to get better", "[-0.25] [Spring 2018] More difficult than Music 12A, but for that same reason less tedious than Music 12A", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] This class is awesome, definitely a large step up in difficulty and time commitment from 12A, more like a 3 unit class. Don't be discouraged, he understands if you don't get through all the material every week :)", "[0.35] [Spring 2018] It is much more than 1 unit of work, especially if piano is the first instrument you've played. 20 minutes - 1 hour of practice a day is required to learn all the weekly material.", "[0.15] [Spring 2018] Fun class, more theory, much more difficult than 12A", "[0.6] [Spring 2018] Take it! A fantastic class.", "[0.9] [Winter 2018] Great course to motivate you to improve your piano playing. If you can identify notes on a staff and can play a few scales, go ahead and skip 12A.", "[0.6] [Winter 2018] This class is a lot more work than 12A. You have to learn approx. 4 pgs of songs per week, plus two or three scales per week, chord progressions, and other exercises. Requires daily practice to be successful.", "[1.0] [Winter 2018] Class is structured as a group of students all in one room each playing on their own pianos all at the same time, so you won't get a lot of individual attention or instruction on technique. If you already know basic music theory from playing a different instrument (like eighth and sixteenth note values, circle of fifths), some of the classes can be a bit long. How much you improve is really based on how much you practice outside of class. All that being said, the music is generally fun to play and will help you improve. Tim is a great instructor to be around.", "[0.1] [Winter 2018] if you want to learn piano, like...do it.", "[0.55] [Winter 2018] Have fun!", "[0.4] [Winter 2018] definitely takes more time outside of classroom than 12A", "[0.0] [Autumn 2017] Practice takes time", "[0.75] [Autumn 2017] It is a really nice way to learn the piano. And Timothy is a very good teacher.", "[0.5] [Autumn 2017] Much harder than 12A, but still worthwhile if you have the time.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2017] A good way to start playing piano again if you haven't played in a while. Class time is not always helpful or interesting if you already have a little theory background, but most people do not.

Tim makes the class great!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2017] You should absolutely consider taking this course! Professor Zerlang is a great instructor and does a great job explaining concepts and material. The pieces are fun and on the side you'll also get a good intro into music theory concepts.", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] This is a great course. Mr. Zerlang is a great teacher and a fantastic pianist. I definitely would recommend taking this course and putting the effort into learning the piano.", "[0.25] [Spring 2017] The most important factor is to dedicate yourself to practice.", "[0.4] [Spring 2017] - You learn a lot - It's fast paced for someone who hasn't done a lot of piano - Took me more than 30m/week of practicing to get the songs - Worth it if you really want to learn piano!", "[0.4] [Spring 2017] Cool music course!", "[0.45] [Spring 2017] Do it, you'll improve a lot.", "[1.0] [Spring 2017] Be prepared to put a lot of time into this course, definitely more than 12A.

Overall a super fun class, but I wish I had known beforehand what a time commitment it would be (it's definitely more than one unit).", "[0.5] [Spring 2017] We were told to practice five times a week for 30 minutes, but I found that I needed more time in order to be able to play the pieces.", "[0.45] [Spring 2017] The teacher is really great. He challenges you, but also is patient and doesn't make it a high-pressure class.", "[0.8] [Spring 2017] Take it! Great prof, and you get a lot better quickly if you do the work.", "[0.35] [Winter 2017] Take it if you want to become a lot better at piano in a short period of time, but don't expect to get there without practicing!", "[0.9] [Winter 2017] It's the perfect class for students who have little piano experience; it can be challenging at times, but the pieces we're assigned to practice are fun and different. Overall it's a really enjoyable class.", "[0.85] [Winter 2017] This class is quite fun and interesting. However, know that if you've never played piano before 12A it will be a huge time commitment.", "[-0.25] [Winter 2017] This course takes more time than a one unit course! It requires significant outside of class time investment. The piano hw is difficult for those with little musical experience.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2016] Good beginning for piano lessons for someone without prior background.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2016] Professor Zerlang is an incredibly knowledgeable and entertaining teacher, and I hope you enjoy every bit of class!  Don't worry if you can't play the music as well as you'd like; Professor Zerlang is one of the few professors I've had who understands how busy Stanford students are and approaches the class as a learning opportunity rather than a grading opportunity.  Make sure to practice as much as possible, though, because you're not likely to receive piano instruction of this quality again.", "[0.1] [Autumn 2016] Make sure to practice outside of class, and know that some classes seem to drag for a long time.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2016] Totally recommend!

You need to practice a lot to improve a lot. Professor wants you to improve but he is also really understanding that students have other commitments. As long as you show you have put in some work to improve, you will pass. After the course, I'm super happy that when I look into some songs I love, I'm not lost but I have the feeling \"I can give it a try\" and just go to the nearest piano available to try playing the song. The course's workload can vary from 1 to10 credit hour based on what you want to get :) but do enjoy playing music and life!!!!!", "[0.55] [Winter 2019] Professor Zerlang is an excellent and passionate instructor.

Especially if you have taken 12B, take the step up to 12C--you won't regret it!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Very rewarding to play actual pieces (as opposed to the workbook in previous piano classes). Also fun to perform for and hear one's classmates play.

This time around, all the practice pieces are recorded on video and you get individual feedback, which is actually immensely helpful and keeps you accountable for practicing. I'm taking the class out of personal interest to learn the piano, and I think Tim does a wonderful job of guiding you along.", "[0.85] [Spring 2020] I love Dr. Zerlang and this was a great class to take for personal enrichment!", "[0.65] [Autumn 2019] Make sure to practice regularly and you will improve!", "[0.8] [Autumn 2019] It's fun! Tim is a good teacher and a hilarious person, but make sure you have time/willingness to practice regularly. You get out what you put in.", "[0.8] [Spring 2019] A great class! Put in the time and you will see improvement.", "[0.6] [Spring 2019] Professor Zerlang is excellent, as usual!", "[0.9] [Spring 2019] Dr. Zerlang is a fantastic instructor and a wonderful person. The class was highlight of my time at Stanford, and was a helpful balance for my (unrelated) schoolwork.", "[0.5] [Winter 2019] Tim makes understanding piano fundamentals fairly straightforward; in all honesty, though, the work of teaching doesn't lie in him as much as it does in you, the student, to consistently prepare each week's repertoire to a sufficient level.", "[1.0] [Winter 2019] It's an excellent class! All of the pieces that we were assigned to play were beautiful. I really liked that we had a piece from the 20th century.   The pieces are sometimes very challenging, however, the instructor does not expect you to play the pieces perfectly. He recognizes that people in the class do not all have the same level of piano proficiency.   I really liked that the professor gave a little background on the composer, the type of music that he played and his place in the history of music.   It's always a delight to listen to the instructor playing the assigned pieces.", "[0.75] [Winter 2019] Another fantastic course in the intro music sequence. The professor is incredible. It does tend to move fairly quickly, and I had difficulty keeping up with the material. However, this course is meant to be taken again, and there are students with differing skill levels. I greatly enjoyed taking this course and look forward to taking it again!", "[0.4] [Autumn 2018] This course is definitely about what you put into it. If you practice daily, you will rapidly improve but it can be difficult to find time to play, especially if one has a heavy schedule.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2018] i hope you know to practice on your own and have some piano under your belt", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] This is an excellent class.

Take it if you're enthusiastic about playing the piano.", "[0.9] [Winter 2018] This is good fun, although more work than might be supposed. Genuine improvement in piano skills is expected, and is also evaluated in the final class. Zerlang is wonderful.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2017] Even though it's 1 unit, this class takes a considerable amount of time, but that's just the nature of learning an instrument. Professor Zerlang is a great teacher and makes every class super fun.", "[0.4] [Autumn 2017] Take this class. I've now been through the entire beginning piano series, and the amount of progress in just one year is incredible. If you do decide to take this class, understand that you will be assigned a lot of work, and depending on your skill level, you may or may not be expected to do all of it. You get out what you put in.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2017] incredible class! Zerlang is the best. He's helpful, entertaining, and has the perfect personality for teaching piano beginners because he isn't harsh or intimidating he makes you feel like it's okay as long as you try even if you aren't perfect which I really appreciate. Do expect to put time into this course because it takes at least 1 hour 5 days a week to be prepared for class", "[-0.1] [Autumn 2017] Do not fall behind on scales. Take time learning the pieces, and don't worry about not perfecting them quickly.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2017] You get out of this class what you put into it. You can get by with a good grade without putting in a lot of effort. However if you really want to get better at piano, which I imagine is why you would want to take this course, you do have to put in at least a few hours every week of practice time. Overall very low pressure, classes are fun because Dr. Zerlang is funny and a great teacher, and if you follow the assignments and try to play all the pieces you will definitely improve as a pianist.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2017] It moves pretty fast -- and it can be hard to perform in class and keep up with everyone, whether you have a slight learning disability or not. But the professor is really supportive about working outside of class or arranging a private performance, or letting you play with headphones in if you really can't follow in class.", "[0.9] [Spring 2017] This is a great course that takes you beyond Music 12A and Music 12B. We spend lots of time learning to play with both hands together and playing more challenging (and fun) music. Even if you struggle with using both hands to play, Professor Zerlang gives you more time to work on those pieces. This way, the class is low stress in having the pieces down pat by the next class session.I continued working on scales but can now do them for four octaves rather than two. I've also learned all major and minor arpeggios and a few minor scales. Lastly, I've improved on playing pieces hands together and have gotten quicker at being able to do so.", "[0.4] [Winter 2017] Take it! Make sure you PRACTICE those scales and final piece.", "[0.95] [Winter 2017] If you already know some basic piano skill, but don't know what pieces to practice in order to improve, this class is good for you. The pieces are well chosen and both sound nice and make us learn something.", "[0.85] [Winter 2017] Course is only valuable if you practice a lot. It takes a lot of practice to keep up, especially as the pieces get more complex, and some understanding of theory is very helpful in digesting them. Don't expect to keep up with the repertoire in the first time through.  That said, Prof. Zerlang is an amazing instructor.", "[0.75] [Winter 2017] This class is pretty laid back and a lot of people are at different skill levels. You can put into it what you want but obviously the more you put in the more you'll improve.", "[1.0] [Winter 2017] Professor Zerlang is hilarious and a great teacher! I did not have a great time learning the piano as a child but really enjoyed coming to class this quarter.

Hope you can enjoy practicing piano everyday as much as I do.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2016] This was a great class to learn piano in. I have a background in cell, so I jumped in on 12C without taking the earlier classes and was a little behind on my sight reading and 2 hand skills, so I recommend to other people in my position to take 12A or 12B first.

The fee is more than worth it.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2016] This is a great class for starting to get better at piano. He gives hard pieces and you can put in as much work as you want, but you will only get out what you put in.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2016] Music 12C is a really fun class, especially with Professor Zerlang! I think Professor Zerlang is an excellent piano teacher: he explains concepts very well, he makes the class engaging, and he is an approachable teacher. His teaching style is also very organized, which makes learning scales, chord progressions, and arpeggios easier. If you are interested in learning classical piano (at an introductory level), take this class!", "[-0.6] [Autumn 2016] The teacher is super cool and very patient. It is a group class with occasional solo playing, but he makes it very low stress.", "[0.2] [Autumn 2016] Professor Zerlang is very good at Piano, it is just that i think piano class should be private class that is the way you can get most out of it, taking it with 12 other people is not that helpful"], "MUSIC 12CS": ["[0.6] [Summer 2019] Do not stress about all of the songs you have to play, you can take it measure by measure.", "[0.1] [Summer 2019] If you want to get the most out of this class, push yourself to practice at least 30 minutes a day.", "[0.65] [Summer 2019] Great class!", "[1.0] [Summer 2018] This is an outstanding class.

This can be disorienting. Just be prepared for it.", "[0.9] [Spring 2017] Professor Tim is simply amazing, and there is only so much we can learn from him in a pleasant way. Hard work though, especially 12C.

Each weekly assignment is a decent amount of work (a couple hours), and they get progressively harder as you go from melodies to two-part and then eventually three-part counterpoint. The final project is a fugue, which is a lot of fun as you get a lot of freedom. Overall, this course will make your composition and music skills so much better. Highly recommend!", "[0.75] [Autumn 2021] Erik is absolutely fantastic. The first few weeks of the course are a bit slow, and the last few weeks get harder.

Dr. Rose is an incredibly engaging and kind instructor, and I enjoyed learning about and practicing rhythmic techniques that I hadn't explored before.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] Definitely take this class if you are a musician and enjoy composing, or would like to explore it further! You will enjoy Francois' energy and his love for music. The class is structured very well. The majority of your grade are small composition assignments given each week. They are not difficult, but do not leave them for the last minute, as you will be struggling to finish before class begins. Composition takes time and energy. Sometimes, your result will not be exactly as you desired, but that is a part of the process. Just enjoy it! And make sure you attend every lecture!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] Francois is an extremely engaging instructor and he is very good at teaching the course material! The assignments are very well fit to the lectures.", "[-0.6] [Autumn 2022] For those who are not the strongest at sight reading, following the lectures can be difficult at times.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] Eh. Not really all that exciting, but it did force me to write things I would never write on my own. There are other composition courses that were more exciting and useful. That being said, it's not very time consuming and its an ok course.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] Definitely take this course if you are interested in any type of music composition! The techniques taught in this class are very eye-opening, and I feel much more prepared now to include rhythmic variety in my compositions. Professor Rose is also very enthusiastic and his lectures are very enjoyable.", "[0.65] [Winter 2022] Highly recommend this class to anyone interested in writing music.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Super fun and interesting composition course that introduces the art of composing in a not so scary way (coming from someone with little prior composition experience). The weekly assignments are very much what you make of them: they can take as little time as you want or more time if you get in a groove/want to make something that you're more proud of. Be sure to make note of the weekly listenings during seminar as they will reappear at the end of quarter quiz.", "[0.6] [Winter 2022] If you are taking this course out of interest be prepared for heavy classical theory", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Solid class. Worth checking out if you are into music composition of any kind. I find certain topics very helpful in solidifying some ideas I have but did not formalize previously. A lot of fascinating pieces are also presented and analyzed, so I would recommend if you need some 20th century music recommendations.", "[0.65] [Winter 2022] If you are a composer, it's a good way to get practice with a handful of cool rhythm techniques -- especially techniques from 20th century music.", "[0.75] [Winter 2022] I think this course is a good survey of techniques for composition. Simply being introduced to these techniques is a good thing, but you'll probably get more value out of the course by working hard on the technical exercises and carefully looking at the feedback.", "[0.8] [Winter 2022] This class is really interesting. Really eye opening some of the topics and you will learn a lot. Be ready to make short (~8 measure) compositions with cool rhythmic ideas in it each week.", "[0.7] [Winter 2022] Very fun, will end up with 8 cool and short pieces.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] TAKE IT! It's a super fun way to learn a ton of different techniques, and apply them to your own music. The weekly composition exercises are a great way to test and develop your understanding. A super fun course!", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] Nick is great - extremely intelligent, measured and supportive, and the class is eye-opening in terms of rhythmic depth and complexity. Sometimes a few of the subjects can feel a little daunting, especially for someone without classical training, but still informative and Nick is there to help if you have any issues.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2021] Lectures are very informative and engaging and are packed with interesting rhythmic techniques I have never thought of. I have enjoyed listening to a lot of the music samples Francois selected for us despite their novelty and unconventionality. Each of the weekly composition exercises is carefully designed with a clear purpose, but students have lots of freedom in how they want to apply what they have learned. Lectures might seem a bit fast-faced at the beginning, but I got used to it after the first two weeks, and Francois always made sure that every student understood the concept and would kindly pause to answer any questions we came up with. He is extremely enthusiastic and knowledgeable about what he teaches. He is also one of the most understanding, humorous, accessible, and caring professors I have met.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2021] Make sure to pay attention in class because the instructor tends to move quickly, though he is very keen to make sure all students are on the same page.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2021] This course is really interesting. Lots of great information. Francois Rose is a very energetic and engaging teacher. Sometimes, the material goes by very quickly and is hard to understand, but reach out to your teacher!", "[0.75] [Autumn 2021] This is a super cool introduction to complex rhythmic ideas that will challenge you without forcing you to do too much work.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2021] Professor Rose is one of the best instructors I've ever had. If you're considering composition at all, take this course.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2021] If you are interested in music composition and rhythmic design, this is the class for you. If not, you definitely need a fairly solid music background before taking the class. Professor Rose is extremely knowledgeable and cares deeply about all the content he teaches, but the content flies by very quickly and it can be difficult to grasp everything. Some of the concepts are confusing and I am not sure they stuck with me enough to be used in the future without further exploration. That said, if you don't get a concept, you have to ask or else you will be unable to apply what you learned to that weeks assignments. If you do have a solid music background, however, it could be an easy and enjoyable 1-2 units.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2021] start the composition assignments early and don't be afraid to email your questions", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] Fran\u00e7ois is a very lovely professor! This class is pretty interesting, and not hard to keep up with. The assignments can be a little time-consuming if you want to put more effort into it, but make sure that you really understand the concepts explained in class before you start.", "[0.4] [Autumn 2021] Show up to lectures because its pretty hard to make up on your own", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Dr. Rose is always so passionate about teaching. He does an awesome job! This class is good if you are into classical composition (coming from a commercial background, I learned to approach rhythm from a different angle).", "[0.7] [Autumn 2021] Incredible instruction! While fast-paced, you learn a lot of cool compositional techniques for a class that only meets once a week for an hour. You'll perceive rhythm in a completely new way. Highly recommend!", "[1.0] [Winter 2021] This course is one of the most rewarding experiences you will have as a composition student at Stanford. You might wonder how much there really is to rhythm, and you will be amazed at all of the different devices and techniques you can explore based on the concept of rhythm alone.\n\n\n\nThe class certainly becomes more challenging with every week: at the beginning, the techniques discussed are fairly straightforward (like pulsations and time signatures), but as you progress through the course, you will be performing a significant amount of mathematical computation before even beginning to compose. You will gain an appreciation for planning out your compositions through a rigorous process. And Professor Rose is an extraordinarily genial and enthusiastic instructor who has studied with renowned composers!\n\n\n\nI recommend getting Finale or Sibelius for notation purposes since you will be asked to provide analyses of all of your scores.", "[0.4] [Winter 2021] This is an amazing course in exposing you to diverse compositional techniques involving rhythm.", "[0.35] [Winter 2021] I think anyone who has an interest in composition should strongly consider taking the course, even if they aren't confident in their musical knowledge and skill.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] If you are considering or simply interested in composition, this class is very useful in helping you understand the basic ideas that composers use to write their pieces. All of the content in this course is relevant to future works and Francois is an extremely considerate and kind teacher.", "[0.8] [Winter 2021] I highly recommend this course to anyone aspiring to become a composer\u2014there are so many rhythmic techniques I've never considered before, and this course teaches them extremely well! I feel like I have a lot more tools in my arsenal now that I've taken this course, and I believe a lot of students feel the same way!", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] Great composition course! I learned a lot, and enjoyed all the assignments. Francois is a super cool instructor, very passionate about music.", "[1.0] [Winter 2021] Another amazing course offering by Professor Rose. These techniques for rhythmic design are very fun and as everyone else has already said, Professor Rose is an amazing teacher who is super organized, very passionate about teaching, and has great wisdom to share. A pleasure taking this course.", "[0.75] [Winter 2021] Francois is sweet and enthusiastic! You'll learn a lot", "[0.55] [Winter 2021] You can get a lot out of this class no matter your background in composition. Have fun with the assignments!", "[0.65] [Winter 2021] This is a great class for any prospective composers. You will undoubtedly face new challenges and possibilities as the concept of rhythm is stretched to the max.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2019] It's very eye-opening. The weekly composition assignments take non-trivial amount of time (about 1-2 hours depending on how much effort you put in)", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] Definitely take it. Professor Rose is engaging and kind, yet disciplined. He will help you no matter what situation as long as you reach out.", "[-0.2] [Autumn 2019] Don't worry about your compositions not sounding great, just focus on developing the idea", "[1.0] [Autumn 2019] Take this course!! Prof. Rose is terrific; he brings so much enthusiasm and explains the concepts entertainingly yet clearly. Everything you learn is super interesting. Well organized and each composition assignment is open-ended enough that you can make it as easy or difficult as you want. All skill levels will definitely learn something! If you don't have a tolerance for dissonance, build it :) this is modern music through and through.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] Absolutely fantastic. You'll hear some pretty out-there music but it'll grow on you, and Prof. Francois passionately explains everything about why the techniques being used are cool and why you should try them.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2019] You need prior music theory knowledge.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2019] Take it! The professor is great and it's very interesting.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2019] If you have a strong musical background, and want to write music, you should take this course.", "[0.25] [Autumn 2019] This class requires a moderate understanding of music fundamentals: the staff, time signatures, and some notation program of your choice. Keep that in mind, or you'll be unpleasantly surprised.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Definitely take it if you want to get a better understanding of rhythmic techniques in postmodern music! It's super interesting material, but if you're a complete beginner to composition (or even a little experienced), the content might get overwhelming. Students like to seem like they have it all together, but we're all a little confused. So don't get discouraged! Also, this class might be more appropriately labeled as 3 units.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] Wonderful class, Professor Rose is amazing. Be prepared to put in real effort.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] absolutely fantastic instructor, engaging material, definitely need some background on the subject before taking it", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] Definitely take it! Francois is a wonderful, enthusiastic professor and is also a wonderful teacher!", "[0.75] [Autumn 2018] If you are interested in composition and have some amount of music theory background, I would certainly recommend this course.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2018] Great composition class", "[0.35] [Autumn 2018] This is a great class but a lot of work for one unit.", "[0.3] [Autumn 2018] Please take it with Francois.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] francois is an EXCELLENT professor and the class is so very engaging!", "[1.0] [Autumn 2017] This course is perfect if you wish to gain some practice in composition as well as gain some insight into some techniques that can help you compose some very fun and complex rhythms in a structured manner. The best part about the class is that even though it teaches you ways to compose music, it still encourages you to be creative and use your own style to interpret the techniques.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2017] I would recommend it if you have experience in contemporary composition. This class is not for the faint of heart and many of the concepts we explain are very advanced, but Francois does an amazing job of making sure that nobody gets left behind. And just by himself, Francois is an absolutely amazing instructor, just be aware that this class will feel like more than a one-unit class because some of the assignments can take a long time to digest and create.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2017] Regarding the instructor, professor Francois is amazing. He is not only knowledgeable about his teaching material, he is passionate about it. He is also super communicative and encouraging of students to ask questions. This was my first impression of him, and I came out of the quarter with the same impression, only more profound. He has been one of the professors I have had at Stanford.  Regarding academics, I found the material to be very challenging, but even more mind-opening. I would recommend coming into this class with a strong background in music theory and some experience in using music notation software to compose. That way, you will be able to appreciate the material from a more thorough perspective and make it your own better.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2017] If Francois is teaching this, and you're interested in either composition or theory (particular rhythmic theory), don't miss out on this course! You'll get out of the class what you put into the assignments and how you pay attention in lecture.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2017] Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois is an amazingly knowledgeable and enthusiastic prof who really cares about his students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 development.  The class material can be a little daunting if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have experience with composition / contemporary art music, but Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois is always willing to take the time to break it down for you!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2017] Rose is super fun and an excellent teacher. The materials of this class are interesting."], "MUSIC 123B": ["[0.45] [Winter 2022] If you are at all interesting in writing music, take this class!", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Take this course. Francois is such a good teacher and is willing to take the time to make sure you understand the content. Some music theory background is definitely recommended. The assignments were super fun and this course taught me a lot of new ways to look at music composition.", "[0.7] [Winter 2022] The course goes quickly, but the grading is very generous.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] This course was really hard for me because I cannot grasp modal composition, and I do not know if I ever will be able to. It does not line up with the style of music I like to write, and because of that, I had an incredibly difficult time with assignments and feeling motivated to complete them. However, the importance of what is taught in this class is indisputable; it is really cool to see the different ways modal composers create 'colors' and a variety of emotions.", "[0.65] [Winter 2022] Francois is the best!", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] beware: you definitely need to know theory/music notation. the content covered in this class focuses on contemporary composition, untraditional stuff. That being said-- it was a very eye-opening course for me! I had no clue there were so many different ways of writing music, and very diverse approaches. The assignments definitely took me more time than I thought they would, but if you put in the work, Dr Rose gives excellent feedback on your work and you'll learn a lot! Francois' enthusiasm made this class very exciting as well!", "[0.3] [Winter 2022] Professor Rose is an excellent instructor. This class wasn't my personal favorite mostly because I'm not a huge fan of a lot of the pitch systems that we covered (this is just personal taste, though). Overall, the material is very well-taught, and I think it's generally a good class for aspiring composers to take.", "[1.0] [Winter 2022] TAKE IT! Francois is AMAZING! I've never had such a caring, friendly, and supportive instructor. He has so much to teach you, and his feedback on assignments are super helpful. I'd never studied composition before, and I feel like this course opened my eyes to so many interesting techniques that I had the chance to use in my own music. An amazing course experience!", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Francois is an incredible professor who knows his stuff and is always willing to help to whatever extent you need, so use this to your advantage! The topics covered are very complex, and I sometimes felt like we were going through the content a bit fast. Definitely designed for the music-experienced, and you will likely want to have taken 123A first (not necessary, though). Still, the final products are very fun. Recommend for those interested in new composition techniques!", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Francois is a great person, but the composition methods he teaches aren't very interesting to me -- someone interested in popular music with a jazz background. It follows the general eurocentrism of the music department that prizes old european composer who's music is pretty bland and boring imo.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] Francois is an amazing instructor, truly understands how to cover a ton of subjects while prioritizing both the learning and well being of the students.", "[0.4] [Winter 2022] If you're working on the exercise and you are confused on the technique you want to employ, never hesitate to email Dr. Rose and ask for help!", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Definitely take it! Francois is a very sweet professor, and he explains the content very well, and the material covered is incredibly interesting. You'll be surprised by the number of ways you can think of pitches.", "[0.7] [Spring 2022] Class is fun, you definitely need to know how to compose beforehand", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] Nick is friendly and knowledgeable! Good, low commitment class to try out some new composition ideas. However, while I realize that this is meant to be a survey course, I still felt we went though some the examples too fast. Instead of sometimes going through many examples in a class, I would have appreciated spending more time with just a few.", "[0.7] [Spring 2022] Very fun class. Highly recommended.", "[-0.25] [Spring 2022] It definitely requires some familiarity with music (mainly how to write music), but no music theory is necessary at all. It is a really chill class and exposes you to new types of music and expands the definition of what music is.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] Chill class that you get a chance to put in as much effort as you can. Make sure you take advantage of everything from this class. I've never taken a music class at Stanford so this was a gentle intro to composing for me and also learning about pitch design in general. Nick is a great instructor and he truly wants to help you become a better musician. You'll get out of this course what you put in.", "[0.95] [Summer 2021] Amazing class, super interesting for prospective composers, amazing instructor", "[0.8] [Summer 2021] This is a great course that provides you with a variety of techniques in pitches to make your compositions more interesting!", "[0.95] [Summer 2021] You'll learn a ton of techniques for developing pitch material, way different from other theory classes! I can think about harmonic systems in many more ways now. Francois gives great explanations for complicated methods with his signature charm and glee.", "[0.8] [Summer 2021] This is a great course for students at all interested in music composition. There is something for everyone to learn and it really focuses on different ways you and other composers utilize pitch.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] Francois is so sweet and provides incredibly-directly, individualized feedback. Definitely come in with prior knowledge and strong theory abilities, and try to set aside time to do the homework rather than doing it last minute (will make it more enjoyable and will increase one's own understanding). Francois puts a smile on people's faces, and that is so important.", "[0.8] [Winter 2021] This is my favorite course that I have taken so far at Stanford. Francois is such an engaging lecturer and I had fun every single class; I would be surprised (and disappointed) when the 50 minutes were up! If you can take this, do.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] Take this class if you're at all interested in composition! Francois is an amazing lecturer and packs so much information in well planned 50 min lectures. The non-composing technical exercises were a little boring, but the composition assignments were super fun to complete! You will get so much more out of this class if you put effort into the assignments, though you can do the bare minimum in little time.", "[0.85] [Winter 2021] I highly recommend this course to anyone aspiring to become a composer\u2014I learned so many fascinating techniques in this course, and my compositional skills improved significantly as a result!", "[0.9] [Winter 2021] Great composition course!

Take a class with him (whether it be this one or others)", "[0.9] [Winter 2018] Francois is a great instructor. This is definitely more than a one unit class. The technical exercises are quite fun and you'll cover a wide range of contemporary compositional techniques.", "[0.95] [Winter 2018] This course is a great course to take if you want to continue with music composition. Not only do you go beyond what was taught in the introductory composition class, but you get exposure to some very cool modern music, and Dr. Rose is a very fun teacher! As with Music 113, he still provides helpful feedback on written assignments and wants to make sure that you are exposed to and understand the class material and listening examples.", "[0.95] [Winter 2018] Dr. Rose is a delight!

Dr. Rose is an extremely organized, approachable, and effective teacher who succinctly explains the key concepts behind each culture's music and provides students with the tools to incorporate these ideas into their own music. The weekly composition assignments were a fun way of applying what we discussed in class, cementing my understanding without requiring an unreasonable amount of time to complete. Dr. Rose makes the class accessible to students with a wide range of skill levels, and provides insightful feedback on each assignment.\n\n\n\nIf you want to learn about music from cultures ranging from Africa to India to Bali to Japan and enjoy a low-stress opportunity to create your own music, this class is a great fit!", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] Fantastic course, and Francois is a fantastic teacher. If you're at all interested in non-Western musics, I would 200% recommend, it's an awesome time!!", "[0.0] [Spring 2019] This course goes into more detail into the compositional strategies of other cultures than one could understand just from simply listening to the music of those cultures.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] This course is a fantastic way to get exposure to a variety of different musical cultures in a relatively short period of time. The composition assignments help to lock in the concepts from the course. Professor Rose (like everyone has been saying) is a fantastic lecturer who cares very much that all his students are understanding his material, and he's a very engaging instructor. Make sure you take a class with him at some point and I look forward to the next course I take with him!", "[0.85] [Spring 2019] Absolutely take it. Fran&#xE7;ois is the sweetest lecturer ever and has the most infectious passion for music.

I think Dr. Virzi did a great job tailoring the course to the knowledge we had going into the class. In this quarter in particular, we spent less time on the basics of actually using a DAW and we really skipped over any meaningful music theory because most of us were bedroom producers who had a few years of experience already. Instead, he taught us different composition styles, different ways to construct sound, and just broadened our understanding of what music could be which I found very valuable. I would say this class is good for students who already know how to compose/produce but want to deepen their abilities and creativity. Rather than taking this class to learn from the ground up, just go watch any of the endless youtube series on making electronic music to get a feel for the basics then come back to 123E.", "[1.0] [Spring 2022] I thoroughly enjoyed this class! As someone who has a background in music (but not a music major) and has had a (mostly casual) interest in music production for a while now, this class was the perfect opportunity for me to dedicate time to songwriting and music production every week (without feeling guilty about it :]). I enjoyed getting to listen to the compositions of others and receiving feedback on my own work, and feel like I have grown a lot as a composer and songwriter. Prior experience with DAWs is really helpful but not necessary! You have a lot of freedom to explore whatever style/genre of music that you want, which I really appreciated. I especially love how everyone in the class had a passion for music production and genuinely loves it - it's almost rare to find a group of people who just really love discussing the nuances of DAWs and music styles. All in all, good vibes. 10/10 recommend if you want to learn/improve your music composition skills. It's probably one of, if not the most fun and rewarding class I've taken at Stanford.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] Great class! There's a lot of freedom and flexibility in this class to explore whatever interests you the most. But it'd be best to have some experience working with DAWs already to get the full experience out of this class."], "MUSIC 123F": ["[0.95] [Spring 2022] It was really nice to spend 3 hours on Wednesday mornings hiking around Jasper Ridge with an awesome group of people led by Nick! He introduced us to the world of CCRMA and the world of natural sound recordings and what you can do with them. I wish we had been given a more thorough curriculum to teach DAWs, since I had no experience with them beforehand. It's easy to learn the basic editing techniques so I was fine, especially because the final project was very open ended, but I probably could have done something cooler if I had learned more in depth DAW techniques. It was very awesome hearing everyone's creative projects at the end of the course.", "[0.4] [Spring 2022] You do not need a lot of music experience to thrive in this class.

Take it!", "[0.45] [Winter 2022] Definitely a necessary class if you\u2019re into music!", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] I would highly highly recommend this class, even if you don't have any songwriting experience. I took this class as a poet who's always wanted to try their hand at composing, and who's had some experience with music through playing piano and just taking part in family jam sessions. The music theory aspects of the class were very accessible, even with my somewhat limited scope of knowledge, and I really enjoyed the structured time to put songwriting into practice!", "[0.8] [Winter 2022] While its easy to compare your music to others', remember you bring something unique and creative to music creation.", "[0.75] [Winter 2022] PLEASE PLEASE take this class if you want to do non conventional songwriting.", "[0.7] [Winter 2022] It's a fun class with interesting instruction for all levels.", "[0.5] [Winter 2022] Take this class! Why not? It really is possible to write your own song :)", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Excellent course! Lots of opportunity to more or less choose your challenge which is perfect for a 1-2 unit course. When taken for two units, the club meetings can serve as really fun connection time!", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] It's pretty good - you'll definitely learn a lot about how songs are structured (and how you can use this to your advantage in your own songs). It does get a bit dry sometimes, but the workload is pretty light/good compared to what you get out of the course. The assignments are interesting!", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] This is one of the best courses I've taken at Stanford. If you can squeeze it in, I highly recommend it. It's a great way to meet other popular music songwriters and producers on campus, and professor Applebaum is amazing.", "[1.0] [Winter 2022] Take it! The course is really fun and interesting and it's a great break from a sometimes demanding and monotonous schedule. Mark is a great teacher and cares about his students. Be prepared to write and produce for assignments. I loved this class and would absolutely recommend it to anyone interested in songwriting, producing, and music in general.", "[-0.3] [Winter 2022] To be frank, this course was a lot of work for the units it's advertised as. While the lectures were definitely engaging, I found the class to be more stressful than anticipated, and struggled grading when tasked with areas I was less familiar with. The course has little lenience with deadlines (you WILL get a 0 if even a few minutes late, with no partial credit), and I found myself feeling more stressed than fulfilled while taking it. It was definitely a difficult quarter, half online and half in-person, which may have contributed to the fact that I found little community, felt disconnected from the professor, and felt that the lessons weren't applicable to my own interests (as someone who just isn't into making pop music).", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Everything Mark does is pedagogically bulletproof. Clear structure, of class and lectures. Constant examples, both live and recorded. Humor. Compassion. I've never been so interested in a powerpoint. AND\u2013\u2013\u00a0you get to write songs for homework.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] I would highly recommend the class. Mark is a very funny teacher that also knows a ton about music and songwriting. He explains things very clearly and provides examples of concepts in pop songs. You will learn a lot despite only meeting once a week.", "[0.7] [Winter 2022] Awesome class!! Must take for anyone into music.", "[0.9] [Winter 2021] Mark is so knowledgable and really creates a safe, welcoming environment for people to share themselves and their creative ambitions.", "[0.9] [Winter 2021] Mark is awesome! Great personality and knows a bunch. Definitely take this class!", "[0.6] [Winter 2021] Great class, especially if you\u2019re looking to meet other musicians.", "[0.6] [Winter 2021] Excellent course!", "[0.8] [Winter 2021] I believe that, even if only remotely interested in Music or Songwriting, this course is fantastic. Go take it, Mark is worth it.\n\nTake JayLeBoeffs Music Industry course in addition, if you want to get more insights into the music industry.", "[1.0] [Winter 2021] An amazing course on song-writing. Mark has so much great energy and created such a fun and engaged environment, even online. Would highly recommend. Everyone in this class was amazing.", "[1.0] [Winter 2021] Take it!! It's one of the best classes I've taken at Stanford. This course is a great opportunity to explore and strengthen your songwriting abilities (no matter where you're starting from). Mark is an amazing professor who will get you so excited about the expansive possibilities that exist within music. Overall, 10 out of 10! Absolutely recommend this course!", "[0.9] [Winter 2021] mark is an EXCELLENT professor. the class is so fun and engaging. it's quite a bit of work for 1-2 units, but it's so worth it. you'll learn a lot :)", "[1.0] [Winter 2021] LOVE. THIS. CLASS. It is such a special and safe space where you meet beautiful and talented songwriters. Mark is an absolute legend, and one of my favorite professors so far at Stanford. He was always so accommodating, and was purposeful in making this class fun and knowledgeable. You get out what you put into this class! And if you give it everything you have, you will come out of it being a better songwriter. I went from my \"coffeehouse/in my room\" songwriting vibes to someone who was producing on Logic and thinking about musicality and mixing. Don;t be afriad to ask for help, everyone is more than happy to help! Might have to repeat this class again :)", "[0.9] [Winter 2021] This is such a wonderful course if you are interested in songwriting, either as a practitioner yourself, or as a fan of the medium. Mark is a fantastic professor.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] Don't expect this to be a place where you will show and discuss songs you are working on. Most of the classes are lectures made up of examples of song elements found in existing songs. If you really want to collaborate or workshop, reach out to classmates and meet up outside of class. That being said, the class is super fun and Mark is a wonderful, fun, and caring instructor.", "[0.8] [Winter 2021] The only class of its kind at Stanford!! If you are at all interested in songwriting, TAKE IT!", "[0.85] [Winter 2021] Very good, you should take it. Mark is a wonderful teacher and tries to convey the topics he teaches in many different ways. If you don't learn from Mark at least once in your life, you will probably regret it (please don't FOMO though). He is this legendary. However, he tends to bring in political opinions / politics quite frequently, which may make some people uncomfortable. Maybe he will tone it down in the future? Class experience quality also highly depends on the quality of the surrounding class. I was quite satisfied, though a bit painful (felt like an old person sitting with a bunch of Gen Z. For reference, I am only 20, which tells you about the type of energy you might encounter. smh). Even if you don't think music is your thing, no hurt in trying. Put this on your stanford bucket list!", "[-0.35] [Winter 2019] Applebaum is 40% Weird Al, 30% Neil deGrasse Tyson, 20% John Mulaney, and 10% Snoop Dogg. If that isn't enough to convince you to take this class, I don't know what is.", "[0.0] [Winter 2019] do it", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] This is a super fun class and you'll get out of it the work that you put into it. I got a lot of good feedback on my songs and felt like I learned a lot and improved my songwriting skills a lot throughout the quarter.", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] You learn a surprising (and good!) amount of life philosophy here; a lot of Mark's energy and worldview is applicable to things outside of just music. Take it, and be pleasantly surprised. Mark's a really great guy.", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] Take it! Applebaum is fantastic and hilarious, and the class is super useful! also, getting to interact with other songwriters was awesome!", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] Professor Applebaum is a genius who also happens to be hilarious. Taking this course will teach you a bunch, expand your horizons, and always brighten your day on the days you have class.", "[0.0] [Winter 2019] Take it.", "[0.65] [Winter 2019] One of the best music courses at Stanford", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] A fun and well-organized course. The perspective of the course understands the pop idiom as a commercialized product but aims to study why it works well and finds the interesting elements of it. Applebaum keeps the lectures so interesting and I'm always excited to go to lectures. Definitely take it!", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] Amazing class. Mark is a great guy and makes every lecture super engaging. So many people audit the class which gives you an indication that people just want to hear this guy speak and give us his vast knowledge", "[0.85] [Winter 2019] It is soo fun. This was my last class on a day that I had class from 9 am to 6 pm straight, and I loved every second of it", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] Have you ever tried producing music/produced music? Then, take this class. It gives some great insights into music production. Everyone walks away with something different, and you might make some useful music connections to boot. I wouldn't take this class if you're unfamiliar with using a DAW; the assignments can be quite beastly if you've never used one before. Otherwise, you can put as little or as much work as you want!", "[0.75] [Winter 2019] This is a good course to take, but a degree of experience producing music is extremely helpful and almost felt assumed.", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] Definitely take it. I've had the privilege of taking all of Prof. Applebaum's classes that a non-music major can take. Simply put, it's a major highlight of my Stanford life.", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] This course is a lot of work, but if you want to get better at all aspects of songwriting and you have the time to dedicate to it, it's completely worth it!  As with all things, you get in what you put out, so if you want to get better, make sure to put in serious effort on the assignments.", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] Take it! While the long class sessions might not always feel worth it, I came out in the end with a better ear for elements of song, and loved channeling my creativity towards creating a final song for the class.", "[0.0] [Winter 2019] TAKE LOTS OF NOTES. do the assignments early!", "[0.85] [Winter 2019] Take it without a doubt- Mark Applebaum is the best instructor I have had at Stanford. Connects with the students, knows what hes talking about, and overall an incredible person. This class will be something I look back on with fond memories in 20 years", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] Highly recommend! Good for students with some musical background, though you don't need any songwriting background. The lectures are enjoyable, and it's a great way to get started with songwriting (which can seem like a scary thing).", "[0.0] [Winter 2019] TAKE IT", "[0.0] [Winter 2019] Hands down, absolutely, take it. You will grow and learn so much.", "[0.55] [Winter 2018] This is not a class that students should take unless they have more than proficient knowledge of music theory and music production. The class is rather fast-paced and expects students to already know the vocabulary of music theory without fully providing beginner instruction. It is better for more advanced practitioners of music who would be able to thoroughly understand and complete the assignments. If beginner musicians would like to take this course, it will be challenging but not impossible as long as they get the assignments finished, since the professor grades fairly.", "[0.8] [Winter 2018] It is amazing, not super beginner friendly but very interesting and cool", "[0.65] [Winter 2018] Great class!", "[0.65] [Winter 2018] Great course! You'll get as much out of it as you put in", "[0.75] [Winter 2018] Take it and have fun jamming. It would be nice to get some software if you can.", "[0.95] [Winter 2018] Super fun class! Highly recommend. Mark is a great lecturer, super funny, but also worthwhile information if you like music.", "[0.0] [Winter 2018] take it", "[0.55] [Winter 2018] It's a lot of work at times, but definitely take it if you're into the idea of writing music", "[0.8] [Winter 2018] It's a lot of fun and gives you a chance to meet people that are also interested in what you're doing", "[0.85] [Winter 2018] Really fun class if you have some songwriting experience or ability already. Applebaum is a really entertaining lecturer", "[0.95] [Winter 2018] Absolutely take it! Mark is the funniest lecturer ever and I always looked forward to the class. The assignments are super fun and helpful", "[0.75] [Winter 2018] Take it! it is a very flexible course. The credits are structured well so if you take 4 it is a lot more educational than if you take 1", "[0.8] [Winter 2018] Definitely must take! Brilliant instruction by Mark!!", "[0.6] [Winter 2018] amazing class", "[0.95] [Winter 2018] Definitely take it!  Super entertaining and insightful lectures, fun assignments, not too much work.  Expanded my awareness in listening to, playing, and writing music.", "[0.95] [Winter 2018] This course was incredible, not only because Mark is fantastic, but also the class gives you the opportunity to meet students that are so talented and you might not even know otherwise. It gives you lots of connections to others interested in music at Stanford! I was so blown away by the talent in the class.", "[0.7] [Winter 2018] Definitely take it! A great way to push you to make more music and look at music from different perspectives. It can take a lot more time than you'd expect from the units if you put a lot of time into your music, but I think it's worth it", "[0.95] [Winter 2018] Take this class! Mark is an engaging and awesome professor, so knowledgable and he uses great visual techniques to help you \"see\" things in the music that you wouldn't ordinarily hear. Really fun class! Take it take it!", "[0.55] [Winter 2018] Its very fun, take it", "[0.8] [Winter 2018] It's a really fun class! It's great to be challenged as a songwriter to write every week. The lectures are pretty funny and educational, but sometimes go on for too long.", "[0.95] [Winter 2018] Great course! Applebaum is a charismatic and fun lecturer. His understanding and perspective on music is very enlightening. Classes are fun, interactive and engaging. Assignments will expand your skills in really meaningful ways. I want to take it again!", "[0.1] [Winter 2018] If you want to learn more about music making, this is the ultimate course for you.", "[1.0] [Winter 2017] Mark is an AMAZING professor! He is hilarious, well-informed, and a great musician. I really enjoyed how incorporates both live instrumentation and a vast variety of songs as examples that really make it clear what he is talking about. You should definitely go in with some music experience or at least not go in cold--it's helpful to sort of go in with at least knowledge of an instrument. The concepts discussed are quite interesting and really opened my eyes to the many ways of approaching songwriting. Even if I don't directly apply or remember to apply many of the techniques, Mark helped me approach my songwriting in a new way and to rely on some key methods to appreciate songwriting.", "[0.0] [Winter 2017] Take it. You grow as a person.", "[0.65] [Winter 2017] I definitely recommend it because of how much I grew/learned musically.", "[0.55] [Winter 2017] You may get a lot more out of it if you can play an instrument and have a bit of production knowledge. However, you do not necessarily need a lot of experience in songwriting to do well or get a lot out of this course.", "[0.9] [Winter 2017] Take this class if you're interested in learning skills to create great music and meet people with talented skills that you can learn from.", "[0.8] [Winter 2017] lots of fun, lots of information, makes you a more careful listener and the assignments are very helpful for songwriting exercises", "[0.75] [Winter 2017] Have some basic background in music, and you will learn a lot. Mark is a very fun and engaging instructor.", "[0.65] [Winter 2017] The lectures are very fun, but make sure you know how to write songs befure you take this class.", "[0.6] [Winter 2017] Awesome class", "[0.85] [Winter 2017] AMAZING. Best course at Stanford.  Mark is so damn smart.", "[0.85] [Winter 2017] If you have any interest in creating music, take this course. It both facilitates time to devote to making music and expands your ability to do so.", "[0.5] [Winter 2017] You should absolutely take this course, whether you're an amateur songwriter or consider yourself a pro.  There is so much that we don't consciously think about - let alone what we don't even know about - and Mark is perhaps *the* best professor I've had.", "[0.5] [Winter 2017] If you're on the fence, absolutely take this class. My only piece of advice--try not to take the one-unit version. If you do, you won't get to be in a synod and will miss out on the excellent learning that comes from the uber-talented kids in the class", "[0.0] [Winter 2017] DO IT", "[0.45] [Winter 2017] MUST TAKE. FAVORITE CLASS TAKEN SO FAR.", "[0.1] [Winter 2017] Absolutely take it. If you want to make songs that stick, this is the one class you should ever need to take.", "[1.0] [Winter 2017] Honestly, this is one of the best classes I've taken at Stanford for two reasons. 1.) It accomplishes what you want classes at Stanford to accomplish -- it pushed me out of my comfort zone to pursue something I felt truly passionate about. 2.) It is extraordinarily well taught and helped to create some of my favorite academic memories of my time at Stanford. You literally get to make music for a grade. What more could you want.  Make sure that you have written at least a couple of songs before coming into the class. The lectures become infinitely more useful (I attended a class the year prior to my own without having written any songs and I promptly dropped the course. This year, I'd written some stuff and it was much better).", "[0.95] [Winter 2017] Absolutely take this class is you have any interest whatsoever in songwriting or composition, or have ever wondered if you might have any interest whatsoever in songwriting or composition\u00e2\u20ac\u201dMark is a mad genius and a hilarious, fantastic teacher, and the assignments will kick you into gear and give you a way to challenge and stretch yourself in all sorts of fun ways musically (only to the extent that you want to (or don't want to) be challenged, though! That's the beauty of it).", "[0.55] [Winter 2017] Brilliant class, very supportive teacher. One of the biggest takeaways is meeting other students (and hearing their work) who are a part of the songwriting community at Stanford, which is not particularly easy to do otherwise", "[0.35] [Winter 2017] Take it if you like writing music. Take it.", "[1.0] [Winter 2017] I would never recommend a course to you more than this one. It will bring out your musical creativity more than you thought possible, make you much more flexible, broaden your horizons, make you more resilient and able to go with the flow, introduce you to other musicians, and really be able to make good music. It will also get you out of your comfort zone musically and technologically, and hold you accountable to improve. If you want to become a better, more passionate musician, and more confident and happy in your music, this is the course to take.", "[0.0] [Winter 2017] TAKE IT DONT ASK", "[0.3] [Winter 2017] Make sure you send the synod reports", "[0.75] [Winter 2017] Mark might be the best professor on Stanford's campus. If you play music (regardless of your level of experience) take this class.", "[0.5] [Winter 2017] Take it!! Very cool course for all levels of musicians."], "MUSIC 125": [], "MUSIC 126A": [], "MUSIC 127A": ["[0.0] [Autumn 2022] Take it!", "[0.75] [Autumn 2022] Mostly focuses on how different instruments/ instrument sections work. If you already know how to play multiple instruments, it may not be super enlightening, but Giancarlo's guidance for the final project is helpful and a very unique opportunity.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] Pretty fun class. The highlight is definitely getting your piece played by the symphony orchestra. That was super cool for me!\nIt helps if you really like classical orchestral music in the first place (like me!).", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] Francois is such a fun and energetic teacher, and I think the course is structured in a way that is fun and manageable. Don't put the projects off until the day they are due!", "[0.75] [Winter 2022] I absolutely enjoyed this course! Must take if you are interested in composing for ensembles.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] I do not know if this is a quality that the class always has, but considering it is a relatively small music lecture, it is likely that it is usually a very small classroom type course. It has a very intimate setting that encourages a lot of instructor - student dialogue, making it better for learning in my opinion. Just be ready to be called on sometimes.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Professor Rose is one of the best instructors I've ever had. I strongly recommend this class to any aspiring composers since having a solid understanding of the western orchestra can be quite beneficial.", "[0.75] [Winter 2022] I recommend this course to anyone who is interested in becoming a better orchestrator! Fran\u00e7ois is an incredible instructor and I learned a great deal about not only the basics of different orchestral instruments but also how to utilize them in various ensembles.", "[0.6] [Winter 2022] Take it! You get to learn about orchestration and it's fun!", "[0.6] [Winter 2022] Great class on orchestration basics and how each instrument works", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] This class was so much fun! I really enjoyed the lectures and the projects. I feel like it was paced very well given that we had to cover a full orchestra in 10 weeks. I would recommend being familiar with different instruments in the orchestra beforehand (e.g. know what a trumpet sounds like) and having some background in classical orchestral music.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Highly recommend this course. I would suggest starting early for the course project, as it takes extremely long to write your orchestration using music notation software and create parts scores. If you want to do an original composition, it's nice to already have it ready before the quarter, so you only focus on orchestration and not composition. Giancarlo is amazing as usual - his enthusiasm, deep, rich knowledge, and humour make everything so enjoyable. Before this course, I literally did not know what instrument transposition (e.g. B-flat trumpet)  was  - but now I've learned so much. Understanding orchestration give you a new found appreciation for orchestral (and even solo piano) music.", "[0.4] [Autumn 2021] I grew a lot as a composer during this course. Absolutely necessary for people interested in classical composition.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] Take it! It's rare to have your piece read by a live orchestra. Giancarlo obviously knows what he's talking about and will help make your piece work both in writing and in rehearsal. So much fun!", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] ~ Start the assignments and final project early. I felt like I was able to think through decisions better. \n~ Read the textbook, I am definitely going to use it as a reference going forward.", "[0.5] [Summer 2021] Francois is full of enthusiasm and sage advice! You'll learn a ton about how instruments work and how to write for them in an orchestral context.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] I feel like I spent a lot of time on formatting and focusing on the presentation of the score (which, don't get me wrong, is important), but I learned so much from this class. Giancarlo knows what he's talking about and has the experience to back that! Super understanding and encouraging--he wants you to succeed!", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] This is a great course for anyone who wants to get deeper into music. Of course, it's a course about orchestration (structures of an orchestra and all instruments involved), but the fact that you have to get comfortable with the various instruments (I persnally spent a good amount of time on YouTube looking up different instruments and how they sound) can be very meaningful for any musician.", "[0.55] [Winter 2021] Never before have I felt a stronger sense of community than in 127a, even though we were all stuck on zoom! The only bummer is that, since it is so fun, this class goes faster than the speed of light.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] This is a really fun class! Professor Giancarlo makes it really fun and enjoyable, and I definitely loved learning about everything. The book (although important) can be found in the library or online, along with a few diagrams from Wikipedia and other forums. Keep in mind though how to plan out your final project, as SSO will be sight reading them", "[0.35] [Autumn 2019] Be ready to spend a non-trivial amount of time formatting and adjusting the parts for the pieces you write; almost more than the amount of time you'll spend writing the music itself.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] I think this course is one of the hidden gems in the music department. Giancarlo is a solid lecturer and he really goes out of his way to make things interesting. Every other week, he will bring in ensembles to play your arrangements and give you critical feedback, and to cap it off, he invites the SSO to sightread your final project! It's really a fun and rewarding feeling to see other people perform your piece.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] This is a great course to have exposure to using the instruments of the traditional orchestra. Considerations such as compositional techniques for each instrument and which timbres blend well will be explored. There are 4 assignments, composing for string, woodwind, and brass quartet/quintet, and an orchestration or composition for the full orchestra. This experience and feedback from the performers and from Giancarlo is invaluable. For me this was a great first exposure to writing for the orchestra and chamber groups. Highly recommend this course!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] It's very different from the music theory courses you might have taken prior to this, but it's also a lot more fun (in my opinion) and you get to take advantage of Stanford's community of talented musicians to hear pieces you write played back in real life.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] Absolutely must take!  The ability to hear arrangements performed by small ensembles each week and the reading at the end is a rare and valuable opportunity, and Giancarlo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s feedback is incredibly detailed and helpful!", "[0.65] [Autumn 2017] This is the best way for musicians to learn about the capabilities of all orchestral instruments."], "MUSIC 127B": ["[0.0] [Spring 2022] Absolutely essential for any aspiring composer.", "[0.75] [Spring 2022] Make sure to go back and review the examples studied in class because they present very beautiful colors using the orchestra.

Record yourself and take notes on what you could improve", "[0.8] [Autumn 2022] Super fun class and you actually get to conduct an orchestra in the end. Paul is very knowledgeable, but be prepared to take very direct constructive criticisms in front of class.

But overall, learned a ton and would do it again!", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] Conducting with Paul is awesome! He is clearly passionate about the subject and helping us all improve as conductors. The environment is safe and very supportive and as others have said, Paul is a wealth of knowledge. The ability to spend some time rehearsing with the full orchestra is absolutely a treat and a privilege, and is a skill I will take with me throughout my life. Beyond the literal core discipline of conducting, I found the material to be directly useful for other aspects of my life. Over the course of the quarter, I built confidence, improved my public speaking, learned and practiced how to engage my audience, supported my fellow musicians, and learned to be mindful of what everyone member of the team is working on as they contribute to a beautiful total body of work. The conductor's role entails juggling many different considerations in on the fly and there is never enough time, but we always have to make the most of each moment. I won't forget the wonderful experience I had in this class--I recommend it for novice and experienced conductors alike!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Definitely take it! It's fun, chill, and will help you improve your skills. The instructor is super knowledgeable and helpful, and you'll even get the opportunity to conduct a live orchestra!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] Honestly probably the best course I've taken at Stanford. You must know quite a bit of music theory to take it, as the course material is not easy. However, it's incredibly rewarding and you get shown a whole new world that you don't think much about as a regular musician.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] Paul is a constructive, frank and skilled conducting instructor. Do think carefully if you are taking this class in a quarter where the class size is big. There are pros (more people in the ensemle to play while you conduct) and cons (you really do not get a lot of time conducting and receiving feedback).\n\nIt was overall a great class. You learn the basics of conducting, get chances to conduct real orchestras (!!), and you also get to learn a lot about who you are as a person and how you present yourself.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] If you take this course, be prepared to spend a solid amount of time preparing pieces. Make sure you really enjoy creating music.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2021] do it! one of the problems with learning conducting is that you need an ensemble to play for you. in this class, we all played for one another, giving us a lot of practical experience you can't do on your own.", "[0.6] [Spring 2019] It is a really fun class, and you get to conduct either SP of SSO at the end!", "[0.8] [Spring 2019] Fun class!

Take it!", "[0.7] [Spring 2019] If you have ever played in an orchestra / band and are interested in conducting yourself (i.e. a chamber or pit orchestra), take this course!

I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in the art/skill of conducting.", "[0.4] [Winter 2017] Highly recommended.

The structure of the course made a lot of sense to me and allowed for us to engage with all of the material before class time, while digging deeper into it during. I liked how inclusive the space was and how each class was an opportunity to share myown ideas on what we were learning about.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] This is a really interesting class that made me feel empowered as a female musician. Professor Hadlock is a passionate, flexible and welcoming speaker, and the class environment felt safe and enjoyable.

The topics are pretty distinct from one another, but the readings are really great!", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Professor Hadlock spends the majority of class rambling rather than opening up space for students to share their reflections or insight. Very interesting topics are covered, including women as voices of protest, blues singers, murder ballads, female classical composers, and queering gender in popular music, but I felt like the nature of the class's instruction failed to effectively allow students to engage with the material. I often came to class very excited to discuss the songs and readings we were assigned but did not feel like I was offered space to reflect or share my analysis. Professor Hadlock has a tendency to only respond meaningfully to students who bring up points that they are unsure about or have questions about so that she may riff on them to explain the concept herself. When students make interesting, well-thought through points, she often just says \"okay\" and then begin a new subject, which is not conducive to a meaningful class discourse. The curriculum of the course is very well-designed, but do not expect to grow as a discussion participant or get any affirmation in what you might offer the field of feminist music history.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] This class is wonderful. The instructor is passionate and caring. I genuinely learned so much. I think if you had any background in either music or gender studies you would be fine. I think this is a great intro class, and the teacher is lovely.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] The professor is passionate about what she teaches and some quite interesting topics are discussed. This class was not at all what I thought it would be, it was mostly reading and responding to readings. Further if you like a clear plan and advanced notice for what assignments are (more than 2 or 3 days), then this is not the class for you. This class is a bit unorganized. the professor is kind and understanding.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] Pretty good class! Professor Hadlock is lovely, and great at facilitating discussions. The readings are thorough, but not unbearable. Really covers a broad range of music genres/social music theory, and there are no big essays or assignments, which is nice.", "[0.25] [Winter 2022] Be prepared to talk about the readings in depth in class.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] The class in the beginning of the quarter is very interesting, as you learn about women using music as a form of protest and being exemplary actors. However, it very quickly gets a little pointless and the professor, while very sweet and kind, is not organized with the work that she assigns. She changes the assignments the night before it was due and much later after it was assigned, and not once in the quarter did she upload a syllabus. She also never really give any insight, just nods in agreement with whatever anyone says.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] This is an easy to understand and fun class if you enjoy music and are interested in the topic of gender studies", "[0.7] [Autumn 2019] This course is super interesting and thought provoking.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] This is a really chill class. Class time is dedicated to discussion. The readings are sometimes long and sometimes difficult, but overall pretty interesting. And if you're not that interested in a certain type of music or a certain era, we only spend one class meeting on each thing.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2019] It is an interesting class if you are interested in the topic. It goes in depth into a broad array of topics.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] It was super fun class. The professor really cares about the topics and focuses on discussion. You get to go to the opera and a classical concert for free which is cool. I really enjoyed going to the class.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Great class! Heather encourages all kinds of conversations and viewpoints and I loved being able to look at music I love through different lenses.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2019] Take this class if you have an interest in any kind of music and conversation around feminism. It's a great introsem!", "[1.0] [Autumn 2019] Heather has the outline for the readings and topics for every class ready at the beginning of the quarter, but still isn't very organized at times as sometimes readings won't be posted until the night before they are due (or at all) and the instructions for the midterm/final presentations were pretty vague. That said, this I think kind of ends up being a good thing as it pretty much guarantees the class is chill when it comes to the work/grade side of things. So, if you're the type to stress about knowing your grades and everything, with this class you can just relax and enjoy the material and discussion! We talk about the history of feminism from a historical lens and people have the opportunity to bring in music related to the course and it's a good way to find new music/artists!", "[0.7] [Autumn 2017] It's good if you have an interest in gender studies.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2017] If you are really interested in music and female gender studies, consider taking this class! I learned a lot about specific female artists and their contributions to women's music. The professor is also really nice and friendly.", "[-0.6] [Autumn 2017] There are many discussions on current topics (e.g. racism and sexism) with past and present composers and artists. It is as much about the context as it is about the music.", "[0.3] [Autumn 2017] This course is not what you expect it to be. You will not be listening to any music after the 1970\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even listen to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hip-hop\u00e2\u20ac\u009d until the last week of class. The teacher also takes up a lot of space. So, if you are expecting to have thorough and in depth conversation about the homework you will be as disappointed as I was. The professor uses a lot of the time to talk about her own opinions and does not leave nearly enough time and space for the students to collectively discuss. Personally, this professor shut me down on the first day of class so that quickly made me feel uncomfortable speaking in class so I would say that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obvious when what you say isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t what the professor is looking for and she does not hesitate to make that known. If you like classical music and music before the 1900\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this class is for you. It was not for me and on top of that I never found the appropriate times to share how I was feeling.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2017] I would highly recommend this course.  I really enjoyed professor Hadlock and the content of the class was interesting, engaging and fun.  Who doesn't like listening to music as homework?  I feel like this is a really important class.  I hesitated to take it because I'm not interested in studying music but that didn't matter at all.

You'll learn a great amount about topics that you've never even considered before, so I encourage you to come in to the course with an open and excited mind!", "[1.0] [Winter 2022] Not a bad course, but not what I was expecting. Normally seminars are discussion-based, but most class periods Prof. Kretz would lecture without stopping for the whole 90 minutes, which usually was on very interesting information but meant that my classmates and I didn't really get a chance to engage actively during class time. You would also expect the material to be almost entirely about Southeast Asia, but I would guess only about half of it was, with some classes covering as varied topics as Kant, Aristotle, French surrealism, or Marguerite Duras. In ways I feel like I learned as much about French intellectual life in this class as I did about musical traditions of Vietnam. I don't think this was a waste of time, but I feel like the class was a little overambitious in its scope, and that Hans was trying to encourage us to develop an entirely new paradigm for how we think about philosophy of culture, listening to music, and reading texts. I don't think this is something that could be accomplished in a single class, especially one where the instructor gave us comparatively little that we *had* to do. So this class is a good class if you're willing to make it a good class. But I think it could easily rub a number of people the wrong way.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] Take it! This course provides a thorough overview of the development of music and musical culture in Southeast Asia. Dr. Kretz is incredibly knowledgeable and accommodating, and he does a wonderful job in sharing his enthusiasm for the material.", "[0.9] [Winter 2021] This class was incredibly informative and Prof Kretz is incredibly engaging. I learned about so many different art forms, and I really appreciated the discussion topics we had that encouraged us to really reflect on the type of art forms that are institutionally upheld and protected, what art forms are not protected, and other socially pressing topics that extend beyond just the realm of art. Definitely take this class if you can.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] Amazing, low-stress course I'd recommend to anyone interested in the topics, regardless of background or prior experience in music/art/philosophy! Work was minimal beyond showing up to class and being present, which was I was very grateful for during a stressful online quarter. Hans' lectures are very thoughtful, and he makes a very conscious effort to gear his lectures and discussions towards his students interests/motivations in taking the class. He seems more committed to thoughtfulness and personal interest than in formality of thought or writing experience.", "[0.6] [Spring 2020] really informative interesting class about cross-references between South-East Asian Arts and other cultures' arts as well as its underlying social/political/historical meaning/contexts"], "MUSIC 146S": [], "MUSIC 147K": ["[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Take it.

The weekly class sessions always featured inspiring guests. The bulk of the work in this class comes towards the end of the quarter in producing the final podcast. Creating the final podcast is definitely a sizeable task as your team (3 or 4) have to interview three guests, use Descript to edit the recorded content into a podcast episode, refine the transcript, add music, and record transitions, but I definitely felt it was worth it as I learned new skills and established new industry contacts.

The TA team and Jay were always super receptive, and I highly recommend taking this course if you're interested in the music industry!", "[1.0] [Winter 2021] Such a treat hearing incredibly successful speakers in the music industry come and talk about their own personal experiences with the class. I'd also highly recommend reading Don Passman's book (the optional reading), which gives you tons of the basics needed to \"catch up\" about music business. The podcast project was a lot of fun and is a great opportunity to make a connection with someone you'd like to get to know better in the industry.

You get to connect with a lot of industry professionals as well so that's cool especially if you're looking to pursue music, whether it be on the creative or the business side. The final project for this quarter is a podcast.", "[0.7] [Spring 2020] Absolutely take this class. You find out the stories behind some of your favorite artists, and have the opportunity to get to know some of the industry's biggest players.", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] Definitely take it! Great speakers and the final project is pretty fun to work on", "[0.75] [Spring 2020] It's definitely worth it if you're interested in the music industry at all", "[0.75] [Spring 2020] ! Cool class with lots of great info, the podcast project is totally useless IMO wish we got to interact more with guest speakers instead", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] Definitely recommend taking this class if you're interested in learning more about the music industry! Get to interact with people who are established in the industry, learn from them, and also a great opportunity to network and get a feel for whether the industry is right for you!", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] Take it!!! One of the best gems of Stanford! I wish we had more classes about the entertainment industry like this. There's so much to be learned from these guest speakers and Jay always creates a project that generates a lot of benefit in terms of music industry connections!", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] This is an amazing class. The guests are so accomplished, knowledgeable, relatable, and generous. Anyone seriously interested in music as a field should take it.", "[0.65] [Spring 2020] Take this course if you are interested in the music industry in any way. The opportunities you will be given are priceless.", "[1.0] [Spring 2020] I would highly recommend this course! It is so fun and informative, especially if you're really passionate about the music industry but also even if you're only marginally interested. Jay is a great professor and really helpful. It's not too much work although the final project can be pretty labor intensive so just prepare yourself for a heavier workload in the latter half of the quarter if you do choose to enroll!", "[0.85] [Spring 2020] Jay is awesome! He really cares about educating his students about the business of the music industry. Some guests were more engaging than others, but it's a class that I think catered really well to an online-only format. The podcast project at the end will be more time consuming than you anticipate, so start as early as you can.", "[0.85] [Spring 2020] This is a fun class. It was awesome to hear from so many industry professionals. The podcast project was also a lot of fun. I was worried at first that it would be a lot of work, but it was fun to talk to people in the industry and it made me realize how approachable they are.", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] A truly unique gem at Stanford. This class is like no other in the sense that it directly connects you with professionals in the music industry and makes you their contacts. You learn an incredible amount of how that professional world works and how it is constantly evolving. The final project allows you to reach out to professionals yourself and makes it very interactive, fun, and rewarding. If you are at all interested -- take this class!", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] Great course to learn about what the music industry is really like and to hear from really important and interesting speakers!", "[0.65] [Spring 2020] Take this course if you are interested in music, and you MUST take it if you are interested in a career in a music", "[0.45] [Spring 2020] This class is for everyone interested in the music business! Take it", "[0.7] [Spring 2019] This course has been my favorite at Stanford so far! I went into this class without any notions of the music industry; by the end, I'm considering making a career in the music industry, and I've written a paper about artist virality post-digital disruption. This class really equips you with the necessary tools to learn about the industry and decide for yourself what role you'd like to play in it.", "[0.7] [Spring 2019] Definitely take this class if you have an interest in music. It will open your eyes to the industry itself and the kinds of jobs you can do within it.", "[0.65] [Spring 2019] Best Class NA", "[1.0] [Spring 2019] I was interested in the idea of the music industry and now I have SO much knowledge! I wasn't trying to be an artist when I enrolled and that was no problem, it was still so interesting because I wanted to learn about the entertainment industry! And I did! Jay was incredible and you get so many high profile guest lectures from cool music people who have worked with your favorite artists! The final partner project is also super informative about the music industry as well and not a crazy amount of work! DO IT!!!

You really get to see how the industry is evolving alongside technology in realtime.", "[0.85] [Spring 2019] Great class! Learn about the modern music industry and meet tons of industry insiders. And Jay is a great professor!", "[0.85] [Spring 2019] Definitely worth the 2-units!  Register early, because there is ALWAYS a waiting list.  Also, doing the reading before class is wise.  The classes are more/less an opportunity to get to know some industry leaders.", "[0.75] [Spring 2019] If you have any interest in a career in the music industry, I highly recommend this course! Not only will you learn about different career paths within the industry and what they entail, but you will actually make contacts from major labels and learn about internship opportunities.", "[0.75] [Spring 2019] Really awesome course! Beware that the quality of the lecture totally depends on the guest speaker that day. There was one speaker that completely wasted everyone's time, and I felt very disillusioned, but most of them were awesome.", "[0.8] [Spring 2019] If you're even relatively interested in musical artistry, I'd recommend it. It's not exactly a wonderful picture, but it does get you a real picture into the actual music business. Surprisingly, it's not as horrible or as magical as people think it is.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] If you are interested in working in music, or just learning more about it general, this course is a MUST. Jay is an incredible instructor and a really generous guy, and the guests that he brings are very impressive and also very willing to help outside the walls of the classroom.  One of my favorite courses at Stanford.", "[0.65] [Spring 2019] Incredible course. All-star lineup of music industry insiders backed up by interesting content.

You get to hear from amazing, well-established speakers who have been in the industry for years.", "[0.9] [Spring 2019] This is a great industry immersion class. The course load is light and the instruction is great. The guests are extremely accomplished and usually present information in an entertaining/engaging way. For example, we got to hear a first-hand account of the discovery and future strategy of Lil Nas X as he was breaking through. If you have any doubts, just show up to the first class. Most likely, you'll stick around.", "[0.0] [Spring 2019] TAKE IT!!!", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] This is a fantastic course. Jay is a good mediator, but mostly it's the speakers that make this course great with their profound insight, complete honesty and bluntness, and their openness about discussing their work. The course gives an insider view of the music industry from the perspectives of some of its top executives. This is an incredibly unique opportunity, and it lives up to the hype.", "[0.4] [Spring 2018] I gained a large amount of industry connections, got advice and insight about how to proceed with my career goals, and learned about the inner workings of the industry.", "[0.35] [Spring 2018] Being an artist feels like a prerequisite in this class", "[0.0] [Spring 2018] take it.", "[0.9] [Spring 2018] Absolutely take this class. While this may be blunt, many classes at Stanford sound exciting initially but only partially achieve the expectations they set out for you at the beggining of the quarter. I can say with full confidence that Jay's seminar is one of these beaming outliers, giving you arguably alot more than what you'd expect coming in and leaving you with unbelievable knowledge and connections to pursue your dreams later on.", "[0.0] [Spring 2018] Take it! It was my favourite class at Stanford.", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] This is one of themost interesting classes at the interface between arts and music. It would sit perfectly at the Graduate School of Business, and in fact it significantly outclasses many of the classes there, in bringing a combination of industry theory and application of practical skills. The guests are at the top of their game, absolutely available and are some of the industry leaders of the last 15 years. Jay is simply amazing. He is knowledgeable, organized, committed, passionate and has a mission. He is also extremely humane and one of the best teachers I've had at Stanford. If you are into music, business, or simply want to go on a mind-blowing journey, take this class. You won't regret it.", "[0.45] [Spring 2018] You get out what you put in - definitely connect with the speakers, since they are very open and resourceful!", "[0.65] [Spring 2018] Take this course if just to hear perspectives from some of the biggest names in the music industry! Jay is a great instructor and facilitator.", "[0.9] [Spring 2018] It is fantastic. If you have any interest in music and specifically the industry it is an amazing and rare opportunity to sit face to face with quality professionals. The caliber of speakers is incredible and they are very open to questions.", "[0.9] [Spring 2018] This is a fantastic course for learning about how the industry works and how labels influence the industry and interact with artists. You'll gain exposure to industry professionals. You'll get the most from this class if you have an idea of what function you'll have in the industry. If you're an artist, make sure you have some tracks on Soundcloud and have an idea of what your brand will look like. If not, you will learn all about this at an abstract level.", "[0.8] [Spring 2018] It's a great class. I highly recommend it.", "[0.5] [Spring 2018] This is a very informative and enjoyable course.", "[0.6] [Spring 2018] MUST TAKE. Jay brings amazing people each week.", "[0.85] [Spring 2018] I highly recommend this course to any student interested in music, business, or both; I learned about opportunities in the music industry from experts in their fields, and the course was consistently engaging.", "[-0.2] [Spring 2018] This is really just a series of informal talks with a networking focus. If you aren't strongly considering a career in the music industry and are familiar with the basic workings of record labels, streaming services, etc. you may not get a lot out of the course.", "[0.0] [Spring 2017] take it!", "[0.75] [Spring 2017] Great (and fun) survey course about the music industry.

Jonathan Berger knows a lot about music and the arts and is very enthusiastic. You learn about and discuss social movements and analyze art. Reading assignments were interesting and not too long. The live events part of the class and the final project were fun to work on, you can pretty much do anything you want. Office hours are useful. Classes were mostly in lecture format and Jonathan has an engaging lecture style. Guest speakers were fascinating and diverse. More formal opportunities for participation or group discussion in class would have been nice too.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] Jonathan cares a ton about his students and the content he teaches.

I went from barely getting a couple notes out and preferring to not play in public in case I messed up, to feeling confident reading some music and playing it during rehearsals and events in just a couple weeks, and I love my time in band so much more for that. It also really helped to have a scheduled small \"rehearsal\" time every week where I could get direct feedback from Rachael and try to improve on what I was doing wrong in the moment. If you're new to your instrument, or new to music in general, this is an amazing class to take and Rachael is the perfect instructor to help you learn it!", "[1.0] [Autumn 2021] I was learning music for the first time.

Although there seems to be some established culture in orchestra, I say don't be afraid to reach out to your fellow players, learn more about them, talk to them! It's a great time.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] Paul is great. I love SSO, but it is a huge time commitment.", "[0.6] [Winter 2022] Great community, conductor, and repertoire", "[0.3] [Winter 2022] Join SSO", "[0.65] [Winter 2022] Do orchestra!! Community is amazing", "[0.65] [Winter 2022] Take it if you love orchestra and music.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] If I were talking to a student about this course, I would say that the music performed by SSO can be difficult, but that everyone in SSO is motivated to put on good performances at the end of each quarter, and that overall SSO fosters a community that is both very kind and is passionate for music.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Great people and Conductor Paul is nice too. Just come prepared and it should be fun.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] SSO is great! You always get to meet new people, play cool music, and perform in the quarterly concerts!", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Fun! High-level orchestra with challenging and fun repertoire and great people (and of course, a great conductor).", "[-0.25] [Winter 2022] As someone who was choosing between university and conservatory, SSO is very fulfilling. High level ensemble with less toxicity / pressure compared to conservatory", "[0.75] [Winter 2022] If you've enjoyed playing in an orchestra before, then you should join SSO! I always look forward to the days when there's a rehearsal.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Paul chooses great rep to play. It is a very good college orchestra for a university that doesn't have a conservatory or music school so its definitely worth it.", "[0.55] [Winter 2022] Enjoy!", "[0.7] [Winter 2022] Absolutely recommend! Good for not only music major/minors but those who just want to continue ensemble playing.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] The level of this ensemble is astounding. Rehearsals are taxing but so so rewarding to play pieces like Rite of Spring!", "[0.6] [Winter 2022] Great orchestra", "[0.8] [Winter 2022] Stanford Symphony Orchestra was one of the highlights of my career at Stanford. The ensemble is welcoming to all players and provides many opportunities to perform repertoire that is certainly on every orchestral musician's bucket list.", "[0.8] [Winter 2022] Enjoy the time in SSO! Each rehearsal is a ton of fun.", "[0.75] [Winter 2022] Paul is just the best! If you're considering joining SSO, do it!!!!", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] Take it!!! SSO is wonderful and Paul is a great conductor.", "[0.55] [Winter 2022] SSO is always a fun way to destress and express yourself!", "[0.7] [Winter 2022] A fun way to spend two nights a week working on cool music.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] definitely take sso! it is so much fun and Paul is a great conductor who truly cares about the ensemble and musicians.", "[0.8] [Winter 2022] If you are a competent musician and love the orchestral repertoire, then you should audition!", "[0.7] [Winter 2022] Very fun and worth it", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] Orchestra is always a pleasure. We get to play some insanely cool pieces!", "[0.7] [Winter 2022] DO IT!!! It's so much fun!!", "[0.75] [Winter 2022] fun to be part of SSO, good music and group", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Great people, great repertoire, excellent conductor. SSO is my place to honestly relax and unwind and find mindfulness - it's a spot where nothing matters except the music in the moment, and it's so refreshing.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Super fun! Great way to learn some new music, make friends, and destress from classes.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] you should, it's fun and you'll play great music", "[0.65] [Winter 2022] SSO is a really great community on campus.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] It's very self explanatory--an orchestra full of very talented musicians. The orchestra has quite a relaxed and stress-free culture, so don't expect to be practicing constantly for it or being stressed for rehearsal. It is resemblant of a hobbyist orchestra in that nature, just with highly talented musicians and very advanced repertoire.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] SSO is, as always, a fun and interesting time, though it certainly is a time commitment. It's always a good idea to practice your part before the quarter (if you can get access to it) to be more prepared before rehearsals start.", "[0.0] [Spring 2022] Take it! SSO has been one of the highlights of my year", "[0.5] [Spring 2022] Paul is a good conductor, and the people you meet in the orchestra are a blast!", "[0.0] [Spring 2022] N/A", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] Orchestra is super fun! They sound amazing but it's not an intimidating group to be a part of. Definitely audition if you're considering it!", "[0.65] [Spring 2022] love orchestra!", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] SSO is truly a phenomenal group to be a part of. There are so many moments in the music you will play that will leave you with goosebumps or an out-of-body feeling. I definitely recommend at least trying out and seeing what you can do because being able to make music at this level is something truly special.", "[0.65] [Spring 2022] Orchestra is the best!", "[0.75] [Spring 2022] Paul is an amazing conductor and person. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who is considering joining.", "[0.65] [Spring 2022] Paul had kind of a power trip at the end of this quarter where he made the orchestra play in a concert (for basically no one) on like 3 days notice. That wasn't cool. But it's a good ensemble.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] If you love playing your instrument and like classical music, the SSO is perfect for you! Playing amazing music with talented musicians is a surreal experience.", "[0.6] [Spring 2022] Make sure you know that it is a reasonably large time commitment.", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] SSO is an excellent opportunity for Stanford students to play classical music with other motivated and hardworking musicians.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] SSO is really fun! You get to meet great people and play great music, and Paul is a wonderful director.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] If you're thinking about playing in an orchestra, then definitely join SSO! I've been enjoying all the pieces we played (this quarter we did Mahler's Second Symphony) and it's a good way to meet people. The time commitment for the rehearsals is about five hours per week, and also add on some time for practicing (near the end of the quarter, take into account time needed for concerts).", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] Stanford Symphony has amazing repertoire and an amazing community, and we perform on the beautiful Bing Stage at Bing Concert Hall. Join or audition, don't miss out!", "[0.85] [Spring 2022] Take it! Good exposure to variety of music styles and good community :)", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] Playing in SSO was one of the most amazing experiences I have had this school year. I feel as if I greatly benefitted from playing with others who are better than me and it gave me an opportunity to learn from my peers.", "[0.05] [Spring 2022] There's very little community in SSO and Paul's rehearsal style is simply running through sections. It's not very organized. We had a Black Lives Matter concert this quarter and the orchestra was notified 3 days in advance so attendance was slim.", "[0.85] [Spring 2022] Excellent ensemble will help you improve in many ways", "[0.8] [Spring 2022] If you love the symphonic repertoire and want to be a part of an incredible ensemble, join SSO!", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] Had the privilege of playing some amazing rep this year (Mahler 2, Pines of Rome, Rite of Spring). Love orchestra - highly recommend anyone who wants to continue with music joy.", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] Repetoire was great this quarter (Mahler) and I had a ton of fun playing with a huge chorus, organ, and 100+ person orchestra.", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] Love SSO, the pieces we play, the community, and Paul. Great de-stressor after class.", "[0.85] [Spring 2022] Good orchestra experience and super nice community to get involved in", "[0.8] [Spring 2022] SSO is a phenomenal student body and we play awesome music!!!", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] Was a ton of work this quarter but the final performance was definitely worth it! However, wouldn't recommend a heavy load while taking orchestra - it's definitely more work than a 1 unit class, and can be tough to organize rehearsals and concert week (~12 hours total on concert week, and ~5-6 hours per week on most weeks) if you have a lot of midterms/papers, plus there's always a few extra (mandatory) performances outside of the major ones that might be announced with short notice. Overall a great experience but definitely a time commitment.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] An incredible community to be a part of. Very rewarding to play such good repertoire with friends and perform live.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2021] JOIN SSO!! It's my favorite class", "[0.0] [Autumn 2021] Take it! Especially if you have experience being in an orchestra", "[0.5] [Autumn 2021] Orchestra with Paul is always a good time!", "[0.75] [Autumn 2021] Paul Phillips is the best. Orchestra is the highlight of every quarter at Stanford", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Symphony orchestra is an amazing class for meeting new people and musicians who share your same passions; and the pieces we play are both extremely fun, challenging, and exhilarating. Highly recommend this class.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] SSO is super fun! If you played in an orchestra in high school or want to try orchestra for the first time, it's an awesome environment to play in! It's a really high quality group but it's not intimidating to be a part of.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] Orchestra is a pretty big commitment, so make sure you have enough time for it!", "[0.7] [Autumn 2021] Be prepared for about five hours per week in Bing for rehearsal, but overall a rewarding experience", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] The symphony is always a good time! Paul is a great instructor and the orchestra always gets a lot done in the quarter. It's quite a commitment but you will make a lot of musical friends along the way. So many talented people.", "[0.4] [Autumn 2021] such a highlight of my week!", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] I love SSO. It is a major time commitment.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] Lots of fun, great for finding your people if \"your people\" are classical musicians", "[0.4] [Autumn 2021] Paul has a very decent staff around him that are there to help you whenever Paul isn't there to help. Make sure to use them.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] SSO has a wonderful community and rehearsals are always a fun time. Paul is a pleasure to have as a conductor and this quarter we played some nice new pieces!", "[0.75] [Autumn 2021] Fairly large time commitment, but Paul is a fabulous conductor and I always looked forward to rehearsal", "[0.5] [Autumn 2021] Thanks to Paul!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Have fun, its an amazing experience playing with a lot of talented musicians.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2021] Understand that the time commitment is not negligible; the pieces that you play can be super fun, and everyone is super talented, but try to decide if the time commitment is worth it if you're not a string player, since winds and percussion don't play as often (at least, not in any of the pieces chosen this quarter) and generally tend to have less interesting parts in the repertoire. Honestly, I think I would have preferred to just practice independently on my own during this time since I scarcely played on the pieces, yet still had to be at the full rehearsals, meaning that I didn't really use the time I dedicated to this class to improve as a musician like I should have.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] If you like playing classical music and you want to be part of an excellent ensemble full of exceptional musicians, consider joining SSO. While the music can be challenging, the performances are fun and everyone is very dedicated to putting forth their best musical effort during rehearsals and performances.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] I enjoyed in-person orchestra a lot. Made some good friends in my section and some others. Paul is really nice.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] SSO is a great experience! If you play an instrument and want to make some new friends, definitely consider auditioning :)", "[0.55] [Autumn 2021] Significant time commitment", "[0.5] [Autumn 2021] For people who like playing in orchestras", "[0.55] [Autumn 2021] Have fun!", "[0.3] [Autumn 2021] Complete all of your work for the day before orchestra begins, because you will be so tired after the concert. However, playing in concerts is such an amazing, unmissable experience!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Great community, challenging and fun music, one of my favorite parts of my week !", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] The level of SSO is amazing! You will get to play a wide range of great repertoire and meet so many wonderful musicians and friends.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] SSO is an excellent opportunity to meet a diverse group of student musicians and play exciting music.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] As a percussionist (with seven players in the section), it would be nice if the part assignments were made so that only some percussionists need to come to certain rehearsals. Oftentimes, a single part meant for one player was divided amongst four players, leading each player to only play one or two notes in the entire rehearsal. Most of the rehearsal was spent sitting at the back doing nothing. It would be better if 2-3 players play one piece and the other 2-3 players play another piece so that not every player has to come to rehearsal and each player gets a decent amount of material to play.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] I enjoyed my experience as a whole. Professor Phillips didn't really talk about emotion or musicality in the pieces, however, and I felt like rehearsals were mostly just playing the pieces over many times, although he did give specific comments and we improved a lot as a group. I liked the people in orchestra though, and really enjoyed the community.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] Enjoy the music! It's fun", "[0.6] [Autumn 2021] I mean...it's Paul...it's Stanford Symphony Orchestra...if you're even considering playing in the orchestra play in it!!!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Take it- I love being a part of the orchestra. Great community, Philips is a skilled conductor and has a good sense of humor.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2021] If you like playing in orchestra, then take it!", "[0.7] [Autumn 2021] An incredible chance to be in a large and talented ensemble.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2021] It is very fun!", "[0.5] [Autumn 2021] Take orchestra, it's fun", "[0.0] [Autumn 2021] big time committment.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Definitely take this class if you enjoyed orchestra before coming to Stanford, the repertoire selection is fantastic and the people you'll meet are wonderful", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Paul is fun and the repertoire we play is great. A little bit time consuming for one unit, but if you love music it's obviously very rewarding.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Take it! Paul is super nice and chill, and it's great being able to play in a group.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2021] It is a lot of fun and is  a meaningful experience, do it!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] This class is awesome. Paul is a fantastic conductor, and the orchestra community is fantastic.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2021] SSO is great! The atmosphere is very relaxed -- we have lots of extremely talented players but it is not a competitive nor intense atmosphere one might see at another school.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2021] Take it! Paul is very funny and rehearsals are pretty lowkey.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] SSO is overall pretty nice - it's great to be back to in-person orchestra! The time commitment is significant - 5 hours per week of rehearsal (not counting practice time) on weekday evenings if you play in all the pieces while being only 1 credit, so it wouldn't necessarily be easy to do well if you're taking a lot of classes that quarter. Paul is a great conductor, pretty much always stays on schedule, though dress rehearsal week is pretty hectic (rehearsals go until 10pm while you're starting to prep for finals). Pieces are somewhat unconventional but Paul acknowledges all the instruments and really pays attention to each section, often providing constructive (but helpful) feedback. Would recommend, just pay attention to the time commitment.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2021] Orchestra is so fun!", "[0.65] [Spring 2021] Paul is great! Even online, we made some incredible music.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] Paul is a great conductor-- love being in his orchestra! Definitely join orchestra for great music and great community:)", "[0.85] [Spring 2021] HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!! I cannot overstate how impactful being in SSO has been for me!", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] I highly recommend that instrumentalists seeking an orchestral ensemble consider SSO, especially once we are back in person. The rehearsal schedule is manageable, the repertoire is consistently excellent, and the opportunity to play in Bing Concert Hall is one not to miss.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] Playing on JackTrip is definitely a different experience than playing in orchestra in person, but Paul and the ensemble made it really enjoyable! It's so great just to be able to play with other musicians again during Zoom times.", "[0.75] [Spring 2021] join if you can! orch is really fun.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] Please join the symphony. These opportunities to play with other musicians simultaneously are scarce nowadays, so I would encourage people to take this course if they have the time and resources. We are learning and growing together, so don't be intimidated. Here to support you.", "[0.7] [Winter 2021] Lots of fun and worked out really well using jacktrip!", "[0.4] [Winter 2021] Hopefully its in person.", "[0.4] [Winter 2021] A very cool workaround for those near enough to Stanford to participate.", "[0.9] [Winter 2021] Paul is an excellent conductor and cares a lot. Obviously, orchestra online isn't as engaging or rewarding as in-person, but a good experience nonetheless, probably the best you can get if you're really missing orchestra.", "[0.85] [Winter 2021] I never dreamed that virtual orchestra rehearsal could simulate real orchestra rehearsal effectively, but it did. Jacktrip was the best part of my life this quarter.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] Paul is a great conductor and really makes rehearsals engaging and effective! Also being able to play music through a virtual environment with Jacktrip is extremely cool.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] DO IT!! Orchestra is such a joy! Great people, great director, great repertoire!", "[0.9] [Winter 2021] If you enjoy playing classical music, definitely join SSO! Once it's back to being in person I'm sure it will be infinitely better, but given the virtual situation I took it in, we definitely made the bet of it.", "[0.7] [Winter 2021] Even though SSO has had to make unusual adjustments this past year, I highly recommend participating in the ensemble; both as an opportunity to cultivate one's performance skills and to learn how to adapt to the unusual rehearsal circumstances of our current world.", "[0.9] [Winter 2021] This quarter, SSO took place over Jacktrip + Zoom, and it was really great to be able to play as an ensemble again. Huge thanks to everyone involved with sending us the Jacktrip kits and making the rehearsals and livestreams possible!", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] I took this course during the pandemic, so my experience will probably be very different from the post-pandemic experience. That being said, I had a wonderful time playing music in this class. During a time where playing live music with others is almost impossible (esp for winds), Prof. Phillips found a way to make it happen. For the repertoire, there was a good mix of more modern-sounding pieces and traditional picks. You won't be called out in any sort of harsh manner if you make a mistake (if that's something you worry about), but you are also expected to practice and be prepared for each rehearsal. If you're looking to play great music in a welcoming ensemble don't hesitate to sign up!", "[0.8] [Spring 2020] For the online orchestra course, this is great course if you want to explore and be exposed to various styles of classical music. You can learn a lot from esteemed people from around the world!", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] This was taken online so of course it differed from the typical orchestral experience by a lot. However, I have to say I definitely enjoyed this a lot. The documentaries that we watched were super cool and interesting especially for those that play in the orchestra. I would recommend it!", "[0.7] [Spring 2020] Paul really did manage to make an interesting replacement for orchestra. I learned a lot about musical analysis and different musicians, which was a treat!", "[0.0] [Spring 2020] N/A", "[0.7] [Spring 2020] SSO Online is a great course!! Even though we didn't have a live orchestra this quarter, I still learned so much from the Keeping Score videos and guest speakers.", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] I highly recommend this course to any student musician who would like to improve their understanding of the symphonic repertoire they play. In addition, there are many rare opportunities to speak with renowned musical figures in the industry.", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] I thought Paul did a great job adapting SSO to an online format. The videos he suggested we watch were interesting and engaging, and I really enjoyed all of our conversations with the various guests he brought in.", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] Even given the weird format of orchestra being taught over Zoom, Paul has tried his absolute best to provide us with a super engaging quarter! While I found the work a bit excessive at times (answering endless questions about documentaries), I nonetheless enjoyed all the materials that were covered. Hopefully we can get back to playing soon!", "[0.75] [Spring 2020] This online course is a great way to learn more about the backstories of the pieces we play in orchestra. It is also quite informative to hear the experiences of classical music directly.", "[0.65] [Spring 2020] I love this orchestra.", "[0.6] [Spring 2020] This was a great way to teach orchestra during a pandemic.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Absolutely go for it! Paul is a fantastic (and often really funny) conductor, our repertoire consistently features interesting, somewhat avant-garde pieces along with the classics, and the orchestra community as a whole is SO welcoming and supportive.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2019] If you enjoy playing in orchestras, join SSO!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] This is a wonderful musical ensemble. I truly enjoyed the time I spent in it (although I was not needed full time). Highly recommend if you are up for the practice hours!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] Great performance opportunity with a highly advanced orchestra", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Great experience! Paul is really friendly and truly makes an effort to get to know you, and the other musicians here are simply amazing.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2019] Students should be aware that this orchestra learns dense works very quickly. So, it is better to get ahead of the game by individually learning the music early in the quarter.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2019] It's a great experience. Everyone (Paul and all of the other members of the orchestra) is super nice and it's a great opportunity to play good music and learn from really talented musicians.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] a lot of time for one unit. nevertheless enjoyed paul's great conducting, the wonderful repertoire, and the passion that everyone shares for music", "[0.8] [Autumn 2019] Take it if you are interested in being part of a great community or if you want to make music", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] Take orchestra, especially if you are passionate about music! It provides a nice break from busy academics and is a great way to meet people.", "[0.3] [Autumn 2019] It's fun, but time consuming on concert weeks.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2019] It's a big time commitment, but it's a nice way to get to know musicians at Stanford.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2019] Great class! Paul is one of the chillest dudes I've ever met.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2019] It is a lot of time, but a lot of fun!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Take it! It was a great class to keep up with my violin playing, meet new people, and play new music. Paul is also a great conductor and makes the rehearsals fun.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2019] Though I didn't always like Paul's music selections, he is a great conductor and leads the orchestra very well", "[0.65] [Autumn 2019] Paul is awesome! Awesome orchestra and a rewarding experience. Not that big of a time commitment but it does conflict with a lot of clubs and events that you'd have to sacrifice.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Definitely take it. Paul is an excellent, kind, and experienced conductor. Every member of the orchestra is extremely talented and hard-working, so commitment and practice is to be expected from those who join.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] It is a time commitment, but it's really fun and we play some good music", "[0.55] [Autumn 2019] Very fun", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] It's orchestra - you know what it's like. For me it was a step up in skill from my youth orchestra, for others it might be a larger step or might be around the same level. It's not incredibly social, I wouldn't call the orchestra a community or anything. Paul is an excellent conductor and very kind. For me a decent way to maintain skills and make a few friends.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Orchestra is great! We play awesome pieces and Paul is a great conductor/teacher", "[0.6] [Autumn 2019] It is a fun way to continue playing your instrument, and meet other musicians.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2019] Organized course, Paul expects a lot which motivates us. Fantastic orchestra, great way to get a music fix if that's what you're looking for. Bing is a bit far if you live on West Campus but in my opinion its totally worth it.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Paul is a joy to study under and you get to play amazing pieces with great people!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] Paul is truly an amazing instructor and cares about his students", "[-0.5] [Autumn 2019] The class takes a lot of time. It also conflicts a lot with other club meetings, which is tough.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2019] Orchestra is really enjoyable! I've learned a lot and I've met some really wonderful people. The repertoire that we play is challenging but fun. Paul is an excellent conductor and has a great sense of humor.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] ORCHESTRA IS ONLY 1 UNIT AND IT SHOULD BE MORE. Orchestra is a pretty big time commitment, so on an average week I probably put 7 hours into it. However, on concert weeks that EASILY doubles. Concert weeks you'll put in 15 hours because you will have two three hour rehearsals, and then 2 two hour concerts, and that doesn't include practicing by yourself. So it's a time thing. The university should really consider making it more than one unit. Also Paul is a really nice guy.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2019] If you have the time, orchestra is enjoyable and Paul is a fun conductor.", "[0.5] [Autumn 2019] Do SSO. It's fun", "[0.0] [Autumn 2019] practice!", "[0.55] [Autumn 2019] Symphony Orchestra is a rewarding experience where you can collaborate with and meet people across diverse disciplines at Stanford.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] Definitely worth taking. Orchestra is super fun and we always need more people.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2019] I love SSO!", "[0.8] [Autumn 2019] I highly recommend this ensemble as an opportunity to expose oneself to proficient performers and exciting repertoire.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2019] A rather large time commitment given the unit count, but it's a good, chill way to keep up with music in college", "[0.6] [Autumn 2019] It's always a pleasure to be a part of SSO and learn from Paul!", "[0.5] [Autumn 2019] orchestra is fun", "[0.6] [Autumn 2019] SSO is a wonderful experience!", "[0.65] [Autumn 2019] I love orchestra!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] Great fun!", "[0.55] [Autumn 2019] Woo SSO!", "[0.5] [Autumn 2019] Very Nice", "[0.55] [Autumn 2019] Do orchestra!

It definitely puts you outside your comfort zone (if you are not trained in experimental/contemporary musical traditions), but Hans is such a genuine and supportive instructor that you end up being able to try out new things without feeling too self-conscious. More than anything, he makes it a fun space for improvisation and experimentation, while introducing you to a ton of new music(al traditions) that you might not have encountered otherwise.", "[0.8] [Winter 2021] Professor Kretz is really flexible and kind.

Always a treat to perform in MemChu and offer our music to a local audience.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2021] SBS is probably the most low-commitment ensemble out there. Rehearsals are once a week for around 2 hours each (Anthony usually lets us out early), and it takes minimal practice to feel comfortable with the technical parts of the music, which opens the door for a lot of nice interpretive work with the ensemble. Anthony's a lovely coach and amazing person, and the group was a lot of fun to play with. It's about half undergrads and half grad students, so it's also a nice opportunity to meet people you might not meet otherwise.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] It's an interesting experience, and learning baroque techniques is fun, albeit quite different from other romantic or classical techniques one might know from previous study.

Anthony provides hilarious and easily understood ties with pieces being performed. Truly a friendly ensemble setting with passionate musicians.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2016] Highly recommended for students who are advanced classical musicians, and have an interest in exploring baroque repertoire in a welcoming and top quality environment.

Because of restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this term's course was held virtually over Zoom, with each week featuring unaccompanied solo pieces from the Baroque period performed by Anthony and the students in the ensemble, followed by discussion about the pieces and performance styles. I enjoyed greatly learning more about solo repertoire from this period and compositions from the original manuscripts, and especially appreciated how well Anthony adapted the course to a virtual environment amid the pandemic circumstances. Given the ensemble nature of the course, and how much more as musicians we are able to learn, grow, and hear from in-person playing, I very much hope we'll be able to return to an in-person format in the spring term, similar to how the course was expertly and safely implemented in a small ensemble format in the Braun courtyard during the fall.", "[0.7] [Winter 2021] Do it!

You do need to audition prior to arrival to the summer session. It's 10 weeks long and super fun; the environment is great and the music is challenging yet fun to learn.

I think that the way he rehearses is also really something of note-- it's enjoyable to see what sounds he brings out of each section and how he balances the sounds.   I hope that our group can keep working with Russ. He's an excellent mentor to us and really approachable. I ran into some trouble with a chamber ensemble that I was working with. Russ replied quickly to my desperate email for advice/help and we were able to talk through suggestions and plans.

You get to meet and play with other phenomenal musicians, are mentored by a professional musician, and perform in masterclasses and concerts. You also get firsthand word about special music opportunities and performances. However, I did not have the best experience with Stephen Harrison as a chamber coach. He can be very nitpicky and specific about what he wants to hear in a piece. This gives an individual chamber group little room to develop their own musical understanding of a piece. In short, it's hard to grow and develop as a musician  under his tutelage because he forces his interpretation on his students.

Much of it consists of listening to jazz carefully, comparing jazz styles, and explaining your preferences and why.  A significant amount of time is spent on the African roots (as well as other cultural threads) contributing to the development of jazz, and this includes discussion of the experiences of jazz musicians in terms of their lives in the South and in the North.  Thus, social issues affecting African-Americans is an important and very interesting aspect of this course.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Murray is cool and super flexible. If you apply yourself to his teachings they are really enjoyable.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] This class was really cool material wise, but you should make sure to be more on top of your assignments than I was. Having to always rush them last minute isn't fun, especially if you're like me and end up writing a lot.

He's very knowledgeable about the stuff, and we even got some additional speakers to come in.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] This course is surprisingly a lot more work than one would anticipate--much more work than the credit count warrants. It is a really fun course, however, and invaluable if you are interested in the music.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Professor Low is super cool!

Professor Low will make you dread listening to music and frankly made me hate jazz. There are tedious, unnecessary, and quite harshly graded assignments that have nothing to do with what is taught in class almost every week. Concert papers at least made us go to real concerts and listen to good jazz; the jazz in class was more like elevator music and pretty bad examples of jazz. The final assignment was quite ridiculous for a three unit class, too. Ten pages(!) on a topic not even relevant to the course. Lectures are completely useless but mandatory, too, and to make up for all the time wasted outside of class on this course I felt forced to do other homework in class. If you do unfortunately take the course, don't buy the textbook, which is never used or referenced. There are much more fun and enjoyable AII and music courses to take than this one.

It was such a great introduction to doing all sorts of audiovisual things - but primarily working with DaVinci Resolve (free video and audio editing software) and Max (coding language for audio, visual, and more).  The teaching team (Constantin, Barbara, and Hassan) are all amazing people and so intelligent and helpful! They're all great artists and it was a privilege to learn from them.  The course is fast paced, as expected, and it's a class where you can honestly work on whatever projects you envision. They give you the tools and help you execute your vision.  I learned so much and would definitely do it again.", "[1.0] [Summer 2022] This is an amazing course! You don't need to walk in with any experience at all just like me, and you will have a great time regardless.

You have ideas? Great, they will make it happen for you!\n\nThis is a super fun class to take. You look at interesting art pieces, create some of your own, got inspired by what you see and learn in class everyday! The instructor team simply knows every nook and cranny of the field, from technology side to help inspire your idea with knowlegde of other artist in the field. You will work alongside them as long as seeing other classmates working on their projects, it's such an intimate and supportive environment that you don't find elsewhere on campus.", "[0.95] [Summer 2022] This is a very well taught course and great introduction to CCRMA. It's such a unique opportunity to plug into CCRMA and explore the wonderful work they do there. Constantin, Barbara, and Hassan are such caring instructors who are incredibly knowledgeable and very talented artists. The course is definitely intensive, but I learned so much and had a wonderful time!"], "MUSIC 18B": ["[0.95] [Spring 2022] As much as I love jazz, this class is not worth taking. In our very first class, Murray explains that he wants us to walk away from his class with a desire to listen to more jazz, but the overly academic nature of the class makes it hard to do so. Each assignment takes an unreasonable amount of time, forcing us to try to put into words the things that we hear. We are expected to be attentive to every word he says in class to put into our listening notebooks for a grade and I often find myself typing away at my laptop to fulfill this requirement than really try to listen and absorb the music. The grading is also unnecessarily harsh, often docking us for not explaining things eloquently or having differing viewpoints about our own subjective listening experience. If Murray really wanted to spark a love for jazz, a good first step is to relax these requirements and turn it from a writing class to a listening experience.", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] This class is a lot of work for a 3 unit class, but it is still a great class. Murray is a very passionate teacher and you'll get exposed to all sorts of genres of jazz.", "[0.8] [Spring 2022] This is a great class for those interested in jazz.", "[0.8] [Spring 2022] Murray is a fantastic instructor! Really enjoyed this class.", "[1.0] [Spring 2022] Great class if you're interested in jazz. You get to know so many of the most influential artists in each stage of jazz history and understand how those styles fed into each other. The lectures can feel kind of dry at first, but Murray is very knowledgable and who can complain about listening to music for a whole lecture. Assignments are more work than expected, and the teaching team definitely greats surprisingly tough. I'd say I put a pretty good deal of effort into my listening assignments, built up my skills, and still got some disappointing grades. Be ready for the work, but a fantastic chance to dive into jazz. The quarter ends with two live concert assignments that are a great opportunity to get out there and do some listening!", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] You'll get the most out of it if you have a decent understanding of music theory and jazz performance, but they're not necessary. Overall, it's a pleasant course and you get to listen to some great music.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] This class felt like a little bit more work than I expected it to be but I think that's mostly because I was watching the recorded lectures because I couldn't attend live so watching the recordings felt a lot more like a chore than I think it would if i was able to go to live lecture. It was still doable and Professor Low was really approachable and willing to review my assignments before submission so I could do better on the final submission. I'm not a jazz player and was just looking for an interesting class for my WAYS and i think it worked out pretty well. I enjoyed the class.", "[0.75] [Spring 2021] great professor! I literally have had NO type of jazz background, and I love that he is so accommodating to that.", "[0.75] [Spring 2021] Professor Low is a really cool guy and is very enjoyable to listen to. Even if you don't come with a music background, he makes himself available and sets aside extra time for office hours if you need it. Overall, my favorite course this quarter.", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] Great class! The assignments are not difficult and focus entirely on you listening to and reacting to music from different points in history. Prof. Low is super knowledgeable and a really interesting person to get to know. It definitely helps to have some musical background or especially jazz background, but I came into this with only some basic musical background and have managed quite well.", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] Highly recommend for anyone interested in jazz. The course does a good job balancing the history and musical components of jazz. I came in knowing very little of the culture/history in Murray was a great educator.", "[0.8] [Spring 2021] ! Murray is a great instructor and really instills an appreciation for jazz and adjacent forms of music. However, assignment grading is arbitrary and from my personal experience, strangely harsh. If you are looking for an easy A class, look elsewhere", "[0.25] [Spring 2021] This course is much more demanding than 18A (Ragtime to bebop) in terms of the number of assignments, but it is not at all overwhelming. The pace is a little fast, but this is more of an unfortunate reality of the quarter system where we cannot spend too much time on individual eras of the music. The class gives fantastic listening recommendations, so if you are particularly interested in a certain era of jazz, you can use the material in class as a starting point for future listening on your own time. I wished that we could have gone deeper into many of the subgenres we talked about, but again, the nature of the quarter sadly does not allow for that.", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] This course covers a lot of material both music and history/politics/social justice. The listening and discussion during class is interesting and the professor makes it feel safe to say what you think about a listening sample regardless of your level of musicianship. He is also open to adapting the class to include extra topics of interest to the students (he added a unit on Women in Jazz this quarter).", "[0.8] [Spring 2020] This class should be required for all undergraduates.  It is so fun.  Prof. Low is a scholar at the top of his game.  His knowledge is extraordinary and I feel so fortunate to have learned how to listen to music with Murray.  18A   18B is a deep dive into the history and present day Jazz worlds.", "[0.25] [Spring 2020] A very interesting class that you will learn a lot even if you have almost no background in music.", "[0.0] [Spring 2020] Don't start the homework the night before.", "[0.7] [Spring 2020] I would take this course if you are at all interested in jazz history or background.

Even without a musical background, Professor Low does a great job and showing you the fundamentals you need in order to get into studying the history.", "[0.35] [Spring 2020] This is a great course as an introduction to jazz, even/especially if you don't have a strong jazz or music background.", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] Murray's knowledge and love of jazz runs very deep, and it shows in class -we listened to songs which spanned a huge range of styles and moods. The assignments do take some time and require you to listen carefully, however. I would take this class only if you have a strong interest in jazz.", "[0.8] [Spring 2020] Take it!

I suggest he uses a microphone so his voice is easier to hear", "[0.7] [Spring 2019] This is a must-take course for anybody with an interest in jazz! Murray is a fantastic instructor and is very enthusiastic about all topics. Low stress class, but be prepared to complete several outside listening assignment and to attend two jazz concerts.", "[0.75] [Spring 2019] This class is pretty relaxed and you will learn a lot about jazz.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] Murray is a pretty good teacher and this is a really interesting class! It won't be like a super easy A though you're gonna have to work, for a 3 unit class it's 3 units of work which is fair. I would recommend it! I listened to Jazz before but I learned SOO much and I can't believe how much happier I am with what I know now", "[0.6] [Spring 2019] Great course that covers a wide range of periods in jazz, but be prepared for a lot of work.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] Great class. If you've played jazz in high school, then the content of this class is very enlightening, and also not too hard to understand. I've found that it does take a decent amout of time to do well (and feel satisfied) with the assignments, but it definitely feels good spend time on music.", "[0.65] [Spring 2019] If you know nothing about jazz, take this class!

Can be hard to keep up if you have no musical training but the work is still manageable", "[-0.35] [Spring 2018] Focused more on the work of specific musicians than history as a whole. Kind of boring and not as easy of an A as you would expect.", "[0.85] [Spring 2018] This is a great class if you're interested in the material. If you aren't (i.e. you're taking it for a WAYS requirement) then DO NOT take it; it will be way more work then you'd like to do.", "[0.9] [Spring 2018] This is a great class for all musical skill levels. Murray does a good job of appealing to musicians and non-musicians alike while giving a good overview of jazz's history.", "[1.0] [Spring 2018] I really enjoyed this class and grew from the experience. It has truly elevated my appreciation for and enjoyment of jazz.   Murray Low has the rare ability and interest in taking a subject and expanding it into deep and meaningful life lessons. He presents the in-depth technical side of music and jazz, and delightfully demonstrates it in real time on the piano, but he also humanizes the subject and the great jazz musicians with colorful stories (some from his personal experiences with them) and with great compassion for the social realities and challenges they faced in life.   He also somehow caters to the wide range of experience coming into the classroom, from the neophyte to the experienced jazz musician. It's the lucky student who gets to take the class.", "[0.45] [Spring 2018] A good coverage of modern jazz history", "[0.5] [Spring 2018] Nice!", "[0.85] [Spring 2018] The course is very interesting but be prepared to do a lot of outside work that realistically can come across as  'busy work'. This class will require more writing than some writing in the majors (5 unit) courses. With that being said the class is very informative and Professor Low is passionate about the topic. If you come in ready to learn you will walk away learning a lot about the last 70 years of jazz", "[1.0] [Spring 2017] Murray makes sure that even if you're not a musician, you can keep up and contribute to the class. He is very welcoming of people of all backgrounds and wants to make sure that his teaching material is catered to the class. If you love music in any way, you'll love this class. Sometimes, it's a lot of work, but I personally don't mind work when it's music-related.I definitely improved my listening skills in conjunction with my writing skills. I've always been a pretty close listener, but knowing how to describe what I'm hearing and how to write about my listening experience was something I had to work on. I find this to be a very useful skill and I'm happy I got to write so much about music!", "[0.75] [Spring 2017] If you enjoy listening to jazz music and want to learn some more about it, this will be a very enjoyable course for you", "[0.0] [Spring 2017] Take this class", "[0.0] [Spring 2017] You're not learning about Black people and jazz...just jazz stylings with a sprinkle of info on the musicians (out of context).", "[0.5] [Spring 2017] Very straightforward course. Lectures progress through the different styles of jazz and the artists that influenced them, while the homeworks (very few) have you listen to two pieces of music and write about them. There's also a final paper which is better than most other courses, but you can write about whatever you want as long as it is related to jazz. You're also required to go to 3 live jazz performances, but there's tons on campus, so it just takes maybe 3 hours three times in a quarter.", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] This course was fun, interesting, and low-key. Murray is the coolest, and makes the class engaging (especially when he plays piano).

I am looking forward to IPAing my own music in the future rather than having to completely rely on other people. The handouts she gives us to fill out during lecture are very organized and helpful.

It's worth it.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2020] Do not be fooled by the unit count--there is a substantial amount of work involved with this course. However, it has been one of the most valuable classes that i have taken at Stanford, and for any aspiring conductor, vocalist, coach, or music educator, this is just a MUST take. Laura is incredibly knowledgable and experienced with this subject, and she makes herself very accessible for help.

The skills and repertoire taught in 183B are a necessary and important part of the musical tradition for both singers and pianists. 183B is a fun, low-key (but still serious) way to explore the world of art song. 183A is a bit more fun to do than 183B, but both are worth taking. Laura does a good job overall with running the course and coaching.", "[0.85] [Spring 2017] Don't miss this class!

Kathryne is the best singing instructor I've ever learned from. My skills have improved by so much in such a short amount of time. She gives you individual songs for your voice and tailored to what you need to work on. You will often be singing in front of the other people in the class, which sounds scary but it is so valuable in getting over stage fright. She also has an audition workshop that is helpful, and the group performance at the end is so fun and a great culmination of the work from the quarter. The more you practice and put into it, the better you'll be. I also became pretty close with some of the people in the class, who are all doing incredible things. I would recommend this class to anyone who has sung before and wants to improve their performance (acting included).", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] Kathryn is amazing and the class is A LOT OF FUN.

All in all, I feel like a much more confident singer and actor (although admittedly I had little experience beforehand), having built some basics upon which I can continue to improve in both areas.", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] Incredible class for intermediate-advanced singers hoping to hone their skills to a level much higher than the general Voice classes. Be prepared to be challenged, and to learn a lot from your very talented classmates, many of which are music/taps majors.", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] This course is a great chance to get one-on-one vocal instruction in the context of genuine musical theater performance. Kathryne is an effective an compassionate vocal coach, and she does a great job selecting songs to help students grow. She offers slots for individual rehearsal, which helps supplements the enjoyable group sessions in class. You should expect to spend a significant amount of time outside of class working on your pieces, but if you do you will certainly grow more confident in your ability to take a song to performance-level on your own.", "[0.9] [Winter 2018] This was by far my favorite course this quarter. I've always loved singing, and Katheryne gave me tools to be able to produce a better sound, as well as really act a song.", "[0.75] [Winter 2018] Definitely take it! It's an extremely fun course that will stretch you as an artist and performer.", "[0.6] [Winter 2018] Very fun and Kathryne is incredible.

Because she is a voice teacher the songs she picks for you will be perfect for your voice but present necessary challenges.", "[0.9] [Winter 2018] This is the most enjoyable class I have ever taken in Stanford.

This class will not merely change how you think about literature or songs, but will change how you approach life, education, and music. Professor Huber has curated the texts really consciously that the whole quarter, even though it is full of different languages, geographies, and voices, work as one complete force in touching your heart. The class provides lots of space for creative critical inquiry, and creative ways of connecting with texts (writing your own song, translating songs, or making paintings).

I enjoyed every second, and I couldn\u2019t say more amazing things about the Professor. He cared about his students, and taught the class with a calm and enthusiastic energy. The material was interesting and manageable.", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] An amazing class! Tom is the best professor ever and has made an awesome course. Cannot recommend highly enough.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] Interesting class! Probably would've been more fun if there were a few more students in the class, but everyone has a strong interest in Broadway in different ways. Prof could ramble a little sometimes but is obviously very knowledgeable about the topic and very open to different opinions. Work is very manageable, a cool class overall!", "[-0.5] [Spring 2021] This is definitely not a fully formed course, but that was the expectation set from the get-go. In theory, this class will look completely different by the time any other students take it, so I can't fully endorse or not endorse it."], "MUSIC 19A": ["[0.85] [Autumn 2022] A very useful class for anyone interested in music. Talya is a great instructor with a lot of insight into learning music theory.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] Talya is such a lovely and passionate soul. Her joy and appreciation for music is palpable, and she is genuinely invested in her students' comprehension and mastery of the material. As challenging as the course may have been in some instances, her support, as well as the support of the broader teaching team, enabled me to finish this course having dramatically improved my understanding of all sorts of different components of music theory. This was my first foray into music courses at Stanford, and after taking this class, I intend to try my hand at many more courses in the department moving forward.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] literally everything about music! i came in with absolutely no knowledge about music theory or what notes or sheet music even means. to be able to combine knowing music theory now and my ability to play by hearing has been one of the most fulfilling things that have happened to me this quarter. talya is such a sweetheart. she is very excited to teach the material and has great tas and every one is super helpful and their primary goal is for you to actually learn the material. a hundred percent would recommend. this class was more or less the highlight of my quarter and it was so fun to do the sections with other students and have the little competitions over who would get this interval right and stuff. i was only taking this class for the ways requirement and i was not planning on taking the series but i have already signed up to the next class in the series with talya and will do the same in spring too. highly highly highly recommend.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2022] A great class if you are looking to learn the basics of music theory. I can be tough competing with people who have a background in music, but an excellent class overall.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] This class is really fun and not a lot of work! I played some music before but never learned theory, and this was a great introduction for that. Talya has really grown on me over the quarter. She is a great professor, teaching not only the material but also why it is useful/important and how it fits into other musical concepts. My favorite part of this class is when Talya starts playing on the piano so you can hear how different intervals, triads, and chord progressions sound.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] I would strongly recommend taking this course to someone who is curious about music theory or needs a fun class to fill their ways CE requirement. The teaching staff is super fun, helpful adn at the end of the day they just want to make sure you are understanding the material.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] This was a really great class and I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a semi-chill class to add to your schedule. The first few weeks were very easy and the class was very enjoyable, but the second half of the quarter really ramps up, but it only ramps up to around the workload of a normal 3-unit class. Talya is amazing and she is a very fun professor to have, but she is a bit unorganized and her lectures can sometimes get hard to follow toward the end of the quarter, but I'd still recommend this class whole-heartedly!", "[-0.15] [Autumn 2022] Do it! Talya is hysterical and the section leaders are very approachable. (Try to get Luis!)", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] Great class! Talya is very outgoing and friendly and you get a large breadth of the basics for music theory. Exactly what you are signing up for.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] It's very fun, and Talya makes it very fun, accessible, and not challenging to pass---she makes it easy and exciting to learn, because you're not just trying to not fail. There is more ear training and singing and identifying chords by ear than I thought there would be, but that is not a component on the exams. As long as you're not actively trying to not, you'll learn a lot and have fun!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] It's a great class, but you will struggle if you have no prior experience to musical instruments and/or theory. On the other hand, if you already have experience with theory, this course is great as a refresher.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] It is a great introductory music class that helps you become musically literate! You come out of the class being able to read sheet music and recognize how to harmonize different notes together. In terms of workload, if you have a pretty good prior musical experience (e.g. played an instrument before in the orchestra, etc.), then this class would be pretty easy for you (you would just need to go to class and pay attention, and you're good). But if you come in with no musical background at all, you definitely would need to do some extra reviews and practice of newly learned materials since the class moves on very quickly.", "[0.4] [Autumn 2022] Take if interested.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] Provides a great foundation for music theory. Talya is very kind and understanding.", "[0.2] [Autumn 2022] It is not too intense. If you have no musical experience AT ALL, you'll need to utilize office hours/watch YouTube videos. Otherwise, this is a chill, fun class.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] For students who are looking to broaden their knowledge on music or plan on composing, Music 19A is a wonderful lively class that will highlight the basics for music theory. The TA and instructor are very well knowledge in Music Theory and are willing to help you at any time.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] This a very interesting class to take just to gain a basic understanding of music. Although I had no prior experience with music, I thought the class was very easy and fun. It only gets a bit complicated towards the end, learning about chords and harmonizing, but all still very straight forward and manageable.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Prof. Rose is fantastic! The instructions were very clear and organized. The homeworks and exams clearly reflect what was taught in class. The TAs are super helpful too!", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Take it! Prof. Rose is amazing, so are Munir and the other TAs. Really loved the class. Definitely accessible to people with zero music background.", "[0.4] [Winter 2022] If you have no music background, this course is extremely fast. It's week 10 and I'm still telling myself \"every good boy does fine! f-a-c-e!\" yet I have to identify inversions of 7th chords, identify a major or minor key signature in under 20 seconds. All of my classmates have memorized all the scales, minor harmonic, melodic, an natural, while I still have a labeled piano key diagram pulled up just so I can count 11 semitones for a major 7th interval. A good number of Stanford students have music background and smurf this class for an easy WAYS-AII requirement but holy moly this was work for me. Don't let this scare you though! I was enrolled in a very packed quarter and this class was number 5 of my 5 classes in terms of priority.", "[0.55] [Winter 2022] A good course that goes over all the fundamentals of music theory from the ground up. No prior music experience is needed. Professor Rose is very organized and makes the content easy to understand.", "[0.6] [Winter 2022] Great class.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] If you have a small background in music, even one hr long music theory video, this class will be super easy. Great A-II and well taught", "[0.55] [Winter 2022] Enjoyed the class!", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] If you're coming from \"no background\" in music and would like to have a class that brings you up to speed with being able to read sheet music, this class is it! With that said, the course does move pretty quickly, but the weekly assignments help ensure you don't fall too far behind.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] take this course if you want to learn about music theory!! francois is the best and sweetest professor every, it is very easy to understand theory with him!", "[-0.1] [Winter 2022] Professor Rose is so nice and very engaging when he lectures. The class is also very accommodating and I thought it was very interesting. The material was difficult for me in some ways but I still felt that it was very accessible to someone with weak music theory background.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] It is a very fun class, especially with Dr. Rose. He has a lot of fun with the class and is also very kind and understanding.", "[-0.7] [Winter 2022] Don't take this class if you genuinely want to learn music theory. Try to find other resources, don't waste 3 units on this class. The professor just says that you are wrong on assignments without giving you corrections so you don't know what you did wrong and you can't learn anything.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Professor Rose is a truly wonderful professor of music theory. He makes theory extremely engaging and is terrific at clarifying any confusion on skills taught within the course. I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning the building blocks upon which music is created.", "[-0.6] [Winter 2022] the final (end of week 10) relies very heavily on material from the final 1-2 weeks of the class, and the class is graded fairly but is a bit harsh", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Professor Rose is a great teacher who is enthusiastic and loves teaching students. A pretty good introduction music theory, as I felt like I really learned a lot. The class sometimes felt a little fast-paced at times, but the instructions were clear and I had no problems following along.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Awesome class, Professory Rose is amazing. Very good at breaking down the more complicated parts of music theory and making it manageable and fun to learn!", "[0.4] [Winter 2022] A great introduction to music. It's possible to take this class with no prior knowledge of music theory but some basic understanding really helped me going in as the concepts ramped up in difficulty very quick. Would have been much better as an in person class instead of online.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Prof. Rose is phenomenal. I love this man. His demeanor, enthusiasm, smile, laughter, and passion for music is crystal clear in every single lecture he gives. Rose encourages everyone to participate without forcing anyone to do so, and creates a wonderful learning environment. Definitely a great intro to music theory.\n\nThe course does, however, pick up fast after triads in week 7, so be prepared to work harder later in the course, especially that it is cumulative. 10 weeks isn't enough to be an expert in all the topics presented in the class, but the exams and assignments are well designed, so there isn't a need to stress. Ear training was a struggle for me, but thankfully I learned a lot, and it is weighted less in our grades.", "[0.45] [Winter 2022] Francois is a very engaging professor!", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] Excellent course and great instructors. Gives a very solid foundation for music theory if you are beginner and are looking to get started.", "[0.8] [Winter 2022] A well structured and well taught course on the absolute fundamentals of music theory. Take it only if you're interested in music theory/have to use music theory for some reason. A good place to start as well if you have experience playing an instrument and are comfortable reading music, but not much music theory training after that.", "[0.0] [Winter 2022] This course is very insightful for those not too familiar with the structure of basic concepts of music. It is an organized course and covers a multitude of issues but moves very fast.", "[0.6] [Winter 2022] Great course", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] It suits anyone with little to no previous knowledge of music theory. The course is organized, low-stress, and it really helps lay the foundation for further learning. Professor Rose is extremely helpful and cares about his students (he is such a lovely person!). I would recommend it to people willing to learn music theory, but note that 19A is just for beginners--be ready to take more advanced courses after this if your goal is to compose etc.", "[0.55] [Winter 2022] The concepts, when well taught, are not that hard to grasp. The only thing is, it is very hard to get a good grasp on these, especially with minimal music experience, in the short amount of time that the quarter provides.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2021] Definitely take this class if you want to improve your knowledge in music theory! Once we get past the first few weeks, the class revs up, so be prepared to spend some time on the assignments if you aren't super advanced in music theory already.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] This is a super great class! If you have any interest in music at all, I'd highly recommend!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] This class paired AMAZINGLY with Music 12A (intro to piano). 19A teaches you the theory and 12A shows you how to put it to use. Talya is a good teacher but disorganized at times. You don't have to know a lot about music to do well. Great way to fulfill WAYS AII credit. Music at Stanford feels very well taught in general, so I recommend for anyone who just wants to take one class.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] a little slow at the beginning, but once we start learning intervals you start learning a lot! Talya is a little scattered and disorganized, it can be a little difficult to follow along in class. but she is clearly passionate about the class and really tries to help everyone do well in the course!", "[0.45] [Autumn 2021] I would suggest that a student have some sort of music background before coming into this class because it can be fast-paced at times. Talya could be very disorganized at times and would often assume that we immediately understood the material and move right on. That being said, I did learn a great deal about music theory!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Talya is so sweet and really cares about students (trying her best to learn everyone's names, even in a relatively big lecture class!) and learning. Sections with the TAs are really helpful too if you need topics explained in a different way, and I loved the chance to do some ear training. The day that our section sight-read a multiple-part melody was really cool.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2021] Take full advantage of all that this course offers--it's an amazing chance, especially if you don't have a background in music, to learn about a subject you otherwise wouldn't have the opportunity to learn this much about.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2021] My TA's saved my life, so make sure that you attend section and talk with your TA's if you have any questions.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2021] If you have 0 music background, this class is pretty difficult, especially since there is a mix of musical experience/background (some people who take the class have perfect pitch and/or have played/play instruments). \nSometimes things aren't fully broken down or explained during lecture, but I had an AMAZING TA (shoutout to Lorenzo) who broke things down during section and helped me understand what was discussed during class. Seriously, do not be afraid to ask questions or go to office hrs like \"hey I understood nothing\". \nSome of the difficulties I experienced were personal to me, but expect to put a moderate amount of time and effort into going over the material to complete weekly homework assignments; also read your textbook!! \nAlso, if you want to begin composing, this is a good class to take to get the basics, but since we don't learn alongside a specific instrument, it is a bit harder to apply your knowledge. \nUltimately, this class is worth taking to develop knowledge about music and is a great starting point if you want to compose, learn ear training exercises, or understand what makes music music, but make sure to use your resources!\nAlso this class is very piano based, and we mostly focused on composed classical music!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] moves really fast but if you are interested in music, it's worth the time commitment. a bit difficult to understand Prof. Berger, but TAs are lovely", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] As someone who took AP music theory in high school, all the information was repeated so it'll be pretty easy if you're already advanced in music theory, but very hands-on class with ear training. Concepts can be taught better / more clearly but otherwise its a solid course", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] This class is not easy, but it's pretty interesting. It gets hard to understand towards the end but Talya and the teaching team are super passionate and make the class feel welcoming.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2021] As someone with essentially zero prior knowledge on music theory, this class was a very accessible introduction", "[0.7] [Autumn 2021] I would absolutely recommend that students take this class especially because it is more chill than a lot of the other classes at Stanford. However, I would particularly recommend this class to students who already have some music related background because I feel like it would be difficult to keep up with this class if one did not at least have a minimal foundation of how to read music.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] I took this class in order to fulfill a WAYS requirement and being a self-taught pianist without much knowledge of theory, I really enjoyed learning music in a formal way. The teaching instruction was superb and you will have a lot of fun if you take this course.", "[-0.55] [Autumn 2021] Content is difficult if you have no prior music theory knowledge", "[0.45] [Autumn 2021] Taking this class helped me to understand different structures in music and I learned a lot. Highly recommend!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] This is a good way to get experience with music theory even if you've never done anything music related. The assignments are easy and help you understand the concepts well.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] would definitely recommend \u2014 not the easiest way to fulfill your WAYS, but Talyah and the TA's are great, and you'll learn a lot if you're new.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] I recommend you take it. Talya is very nice and cares about her students a lot. You can redo the homework for full credit. The TAs were great too. Luis is very real and a good teacher.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2021] its a great  introduction, and you get out what you put in.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2021] Definitely worth taking if you're interested in music.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] I had no experience with music theory(or anything musical) before coming to this class, and I feel the class is a great intro for anyone wanting to see if they like music. I never felt overwhelmed and the teaching staff was always very helpful if I had a question. Tayla is an amazing professor and is very kind so don't hesitate to ask questions or get clarification. If you are debating about taking the class, I would definitely take it, because even if you do not take any more music theory, it is a fun class and you learn a lot.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2021] Great course!", "[0.6] [Winter 2021] Great class for beginners with no experience--Talya and the TA's are very nice. Homework sometimes feels like busy work but it is very manageable.", "[0.7] [Winter 2021] Talya's great. You won't feel pressured to learn, but you almost certainly will learn.", "[0.3] [Winter 2021] Great course; however, online version does not do it justice.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] A good course for learning music theory basics up through topics like inversions and 7th chords. Virtual learning certainly lessens the impact of certain aspects of the class, such as singing along to pieces and composing as a class. Make sure to study your notes and make use of the textbook as this class can get complex at times. TAs are also excellent and always there to help.", "[0.85] [Winter 2021] I came in with a fair amount of music theory so it was a relatively easy course. I feel like I would have been rather confused given the fast pace of the quarter if I hadn't. The TAs were fantastic.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] Great class with passionate and helpful teaching team. Learned a lot about music theory and the class was fun to attend.", "[0.55] [Winter 2021] Talya is a lot of fun!", "[0.65] [Winter 2021] Great course for beginners! Very approachable and you will learn a lot.", "[0.9] [Winter 2021] This is a wonderful introductory course for non-music majors, or people who are interested in getting a taste of music theory! Talya is a wonderful teacher and is very understanding and accommodating of beginners. A hard course to take online given the format of the class and how auditory and interactive the lessons are, but Talya and the TAs did a great job adapting.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] This is a great class that teaches a lot of the foundations for music, and coming out of it, I feel like I listen to music with a new perspective. It was enjoyable, engaging, and an overall great course.", "[1.0] [Winter 2021] It's a fun class! A good introduction to music theory or a good brush up on concepts if you're like me and haven't touched theory in a long while. It's not too much work, a good balance, and the instructors are really kind and fantastic. :)", "[0.25] [Winter 2021] Talya is a wonderful person, and this class is an okay introduction of to music theory, but I found it to be quite disorganized, and a lot of the material was not motivated in class. I was hoping that this class would make me more excited about music and the theory that goes into it, but this is not the experience I had. I think this class is worth taking is in the event that you have lots of time (I unfortunately did not), motivation, and an instrument to do a lot of practical exercises outside of class. Otherwise, a decent unit filler and way to fulfill WAYS, but not very interesting.", "[-0.5] [Winter 2021] If you already have music experience, parts of the course will be review/slow (course doesn't assume you have any music background). Not a great class over zoom.", "[0.8] [Winter 2021] This class is a great beginner course for any students who are willing to put in the time and effort into learning the basic and fundamental truths of music theory.", "[0.5] [Winter 2021] Very easy, If you have done music theory before, do music 19b or music 21", "[0.45] [Winter 2021] Class can be pretty slow to start but tends to pick up a lot towards the end. Lectures can be long and hard to follow, but assignments are manageable and adequate resources are given to reinforce the material outside of class.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] A good class for an overview of music theory - Talya is a nice teacher. It is a bit fast-paced. Big class but we had a tight section (s/o to Munir!!), which was lovely. It's got weekly homework assignments that are kind of like psets so those take a lot of time later on sometimes. Make sure and keep up in lecture or it's easy to get behind.", "[-0.25] [Winter 2021] may be repetitive for students with music backgrounds", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] A really useful course for people that have been exposed to music before or play an instrument, but might have gaps in their knowledge or want to solidify their understanding of basic concepts. The professor is very fun and makes the class a great environment for learning!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2020] Really really good introduction to music theory. Talya does a really good job of motivating everything from intuition or things you learned before. As a result, the pacing is a tad bit slow, but the quality of instruction is excellent.", "[0.25] [Autumn 2020] Talya is one of the kindest professors at Stanford. This course is very low stress and also a fun class to attend! Highly recommend taking this course for those who do/don't have music theory background.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2020] Talya is super enthusiastic about music and is a great instructor. Topics are very easy at first, but pay close attention in the last few weeks when things get a little more complex", "[0.65] [Autumn 2020] This course is fun and educational but probably better in-person rather than over Zoom. It can be hard to follow online.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] An amazing class for non-musical students like myself to explore some theory behind music we hear everyday. Talya is an amazing, funny, caring professor who really wants to see all of her students succeed. The TAs were likewise incredible, and I learned a lot from section. Definitely take this class.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] Talya is SUCH an amazing professor. She cares SO SO much about her students, and truly cares for teaching. I've never met someone so passionate about her work. Talya, YOU ROCK!", "[0.8] [Autumn 2020] Super fun class if you have little/no past music theory experience", "[0.75] [Autumn 2020] If you want an intro to music theory and a fun way to fulfill some ways, take this class", "[0.85] [Autumn 2020] The teaching staff is amazing and understanding of student's situations. They not only want to help you learn the material, but want you to have all the resources to succeed in this class and beyond.", "[0.2] [Autumn 2020] If you?re interested in learning music theory and have no background knowledge, this class is for you!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] Definitely take this class! I knew very little about music and was amazed by how much we covered in 10 weeks. This class is extremely light and a nice break from other classes in a heavy quarter. Talya and the TA's are fantastic and will support you in any way they can, both related to class material and otherwise. Can't stress enough how great this class is!", "[0.55] [Autumn 2020] A really relaxing and refreshing class to learn about basic music theory", "[0.2] [Autumn 2020] Good course to get ways requirement out of the way. Who doesn't like music.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] Really fun class, I have a much greater appreciation and understanding for music now. Lots of notational work, learning scales, and ear training. Not as much music theory(mathematics of intervals) as I would have hoped, but overall very much enjoyed. Very manageable workload, would recommend.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] Professor Berger is a great teacher who leads a class that is  fun and easy to understand", "[0.8] [Autumn 2019] Engaging, useful class if you are interested in music!", "[0.4] [Autumn 2019] There are probably easier ways to meet your WAYS requirements.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] It's a great class! It can be tough to keep up if you don't have much of a background in music theory, but Talya and the TAs are really great teachers and very accessible. Go to lecture!", "[0.55] [Autumn 2019] Very fun", "[-0.7] [Autumn 2019] i had literally no musical experience and found this class very easy. you do learn a lot but it can be very boring and the homework is tedious. weekly quizzes, midterm, and final... grading is so chill and it's hard to do bad. not very well organized.. kinda chaotic and many mistakes on the assignments. talya is very nice, supportive and passionate. attendance is taken", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Talya is just an angel. Such an understanding and caring teacher. Unlike other cut-throat classes, Talya structured her class where you learn a lot stress-free. Talya is also very engaging and clearly loves teaching. Would highly recommend taking the class, if not just to be taught by Talya!", "[1.0] [Autumn 2019] A great course! Depending on what kind of previous experience you have with music, certain parts of the course can feel slow, but make sure to keep up attention, because once you hit a certain part that's new, it's easy to get the material, but you're much faster/more adept if you keep up with the class. Talya is such a wonderful lecturer and she's so nice and actually cares about all of her students! The class itself is so great workload wise, and an enjoyment to be there.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] If you love music and would like to start to know basic music theory and make foundation for composing, then this is an excellent choice for you!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Tayla is literally such a great human.  The content is very fun. You actually learn a LOT for an intro class (we got up to analysis !!!). Talya pushes you very hard on the content, makes the content very challenging, which is good if you wanna learn a lot.  Overall a positive experience that makes you want to take more music at Stanford (from a non-major perspective).", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Fun class! Not the best way to learn the material, but definitely a decent way to do it. Talya is super nice and understanding, and the class is high reward for low effort - best ratio in my opinion. There are lots of mistakes on quizzes and exams that need clarification, but those almost always get cleared up so they're not a big deal.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] This course was very useful for putting my previous more intuitive understanding of music into a formal framework, which has already been helpful in my playing. I didn't find it that difficult but I think that depends on prior familiarity with the subject. You do get to choose which section you're in based on musical experience. Dr. Berger is very sweet but pretty disorganized. Noah and Hanyu are both great TAs.", "[0.5] [Autumn 2019] Fun class. If you already know music fairly well though (scales, chords, etc.) you'll probably be bored.", "[0.15] [Autumn 2019] Good introduction for people with no knowledge, but if you have done music theory before do not take!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Awesome!  Tayla is so wonderful and cares so much about her students.  A great intro to music theory - even for someone like me with no past music experience.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] I recommend taking this course! If you have the bandwidth to pay attention to the course during the quarter, it is extremely valuable and will teach you so much about music. It is useful to apply the class learnings to some sort of instrument so that the material comes to life. Talya is a wonderful professor who truly cares about the learning of her students.", "[0.5] [Autumn 2019] One of the best taught classes I've taken at Stanford. Having no prior knowledge of music theory, I learnt so much!", "[0.75] [Autumn 2019] Definitely to take it if you want to learn music theory. Please make sure to understand everything while its taught because the whole course is cumulative.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2019] Sing along. Seriously. It helps tremendously with understanding what's going on. Also just listen to classical music and try to sing along to that. If you can tap out notes on the piano and sing along with that too, that'll help too. Most of this class depends on you having an understanding of notes relative to each other.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] The class is fun, but if you have some previous knowledge of music, it can be a bit boring in the first few weeks.

The lecturer also clearly favored some students over others, such as girls (literally complained that there were not enough on the first day of class), those who were more vocal, etc. If you already know how to read music, then this course will teach you very little.", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] Great class for any non-music major looking to gain any sort of exposure to music theory. This class can be taken with no music background, and is even more straight-forward if you have any background at all. Talya is such a sweet lady and wants to make sure everyone is having fun.

Wide range of backgrounds in this class, I was pretty much a complete beginner", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] The TAs are often much better than Talya at teaching because they will explain concepts in more relatable ways - using modern music, or tell you precisely what the rules are. Talya tends to lecture too much, and should really just play the music and let your ears listen to the sounds. It's impossible to explain a sound, it's better to just hear it first!

Take advantage of office hours for ear training.", "[0.9] [Spring 2017] Talya is a great teacher and cares about her students. I really recommend this course to anyone who is looking to either beef up their knowledge of music or get an in-depth referesher of the subject!", "[0.85] [Spring 2017] If you've had previous experience playing an instrument and have always wanted to learn more about its formal elements and what makes it all work, or if you haven't had that much exposure to music for some time, then this is the class for you.  The class is very engaging and hands-on.  The examples and activities done in class are very illustrative and fun, and even if you're a bit uncomfortable at first, you'll grow to enjoy the mini-performances in class.", "[0.8] [Spring 2017] Great course, a good way to begin developing a formal understanding of tonal music.", "[-0.55] [Spring 2017] I didn't learn much from this class. It was poorly taught and poorly organized. I did well in the class because I already knew most of the material (took it for WAYS), but was disappointed that I didn't learn more about music theory."], "MUSIC 192A": ["[0.9] [Autumn 2022] Super helpful if you haven't ever worked in a studio or want to get familiar with the studio here. Especially helpful for developing skills as a recordist.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] It is a very encouraging course regardless of your background in music! Definitely take it if you have the opportunity.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2022] Great class to learn and practice recording in the studio. You get out of it what you put into it! It is better to come with a current project in mind and budget as much time to be in the studio as you need.", "[0.4] [Autumn 2022] I think it's a cool class if you want a brief introduction to recording technology and how to operate the basic aspects of a studio.", "[-0.6] [Autumn 2022] From talking to other students who have taken this class about my experience, it seems that your experience in Music 192A varies wildly depending on the instructor and classmates. Hassan has a way of teaching where he just jumps into topics without much thought to how students might be filling in the gaps for context, and this can be confusing if your only background is Music 101. The course is taken by a wide range of interests/backgrounds/walks of life (such as PhD students or producers with lots of physics/acoustics/mixing knowledge already) and, at least this quarter, the more advanced folks were who set the tone. I was constantly confused and overwhelmed. I am still glad I took the class because I learned alot, earned an AQR, and am walking away with some useful recording & mixing info, but I would NOT indiscriminately recommend this class to anyone. It's also very difficult to get into in the first place. It's such a bummer that Stanford doesn't offer more classes on recording/mixing for beginners because of institutional elitism, and I ultimately get that the shortcomings of this class is not the fault of the instructors who are trying to serve as many students and interests as they can!", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] If you want to learn mixing, this might not be the class for you. We do go into it a bit, especially during the middle/end of the quarter, when we're dealing with our own projects, but it's mostly a hands-on, learn-the-equipment and setup type of course.  However, I think that's why it's so great - it's really hard to have resources to get access to a studio, much less learn about how to use it well. Hassan (Professor) and Lloyd, the TA, were great resources and Lloyd was great especially at breaking things down into super simple terms so people who had no experience producing or recording could understand it.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] This was a really cool course. We got to spend time in the CCRMA studio all the time, and the subject is very exciting. The teaching was a little disorganized, and sometimes felt like the lecture materials were too complex for the level of the course and ultimately didn't add much to our palette. But it's not very time consuming, and the projects are very fun, so you should take it!", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Really fun CCRMA class on an intro to recording and mixing by Constantin and a great way to get SMA. It's very competitive to get in (being a music major or minor really helps). The students had a wide variety of backgrounds, from genres of music (it was really cool to hear everyone's projects) to prior experience in sound tech. I had very little prior knowledge, but I still think I was able to get a lot out of the class, from where I started to where I am now. Constantin really cares about the class, putting in extra hours to make sure the tech in the studio works and being very available for help outside of scheduled office hours etc. Barbara, the TA, and our frequent guest lecturer Hassan were very helpful too! It was a bit tough to schedule everything for the final project, since everyone needs to fight for studio reservation time, and the studio physically was a bit disorganized so it was sometimes challenging to find the thing I needed in the limited reservation slot, but overall I had a really fun time in this class.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] MUSIC 192A is a great class for anyone wanting to develop ability in studio recording, whether that person is a total newcomer or wants to expand existing recording skills. The course follows through on it's promise of giving instruction, resources, and space for students to competently and professionally record music.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Probably one of the most fun and interesting classes I've taken here. You will learn a lot of practical skills and have a good time doing so. Constantin is amazing, cares a lot about the course and students, and always willing to help everyone out. Also everyone else in the course was very nice and worked on incredible projects.", "[0.8] [Winter 2022] If you are trying to get into this course, you need a good reason. It is highly competitive and given priority to majors and grad students. I took the class with Constantin, who is only a stand-in instructor for the course, but he was amazing.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] Constantin and Barbara were great! Learned a lot with fun projects.", "[0.75] [Winter 2022] Take this class! So cool and the best thing is that you get access to the recording studio afterwards. I didn't learn a huge amount, but I think a lot of recording skill comes from practice and this class gave me the fundamental knowledge I needed to practice well!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2020] What an amazing class. If you have the opportunity to take this course, you absolutely should! The skills you'll gain with audio recording will certainly serve you well in your future musical endeavors, and the instruction, feedback, and attention provided by Constantin, Hanyu, and the rest of your classmates will be invaluable. After taking this course I feel much much more confident recording sound in a variety of scenarios from voice to instrumental to choral to outdoors. If I could change any one thing, I wish the course could be offered more and to more people, but the natural constraints of such a course are totally understandable.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2020] Take this class!! The instruction is great and Constatin is super helpful.  You'll learn alot about sound recording", "[1.0] [Autumn 2020] Take it! This class is one of my favorites. Constantin put in so much work to make this course extremely smooth, accessible, and adaptable to virtual environments, and I learned so much. I have much more confidence in taking risks while approaching music production/composition because of this class. Everyone is so inspiring, stimulating, warm, and encouraging. Best class environment I've come across. :)", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] This class is so much fun, especially the projects! They are so exciting and expansive. The lectures can be a bit boring, but I think that also might have been zoom. That being said, the class works great over zoom because of the individual recording kits. A great course.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2020] Good class, but not as skills oriented as I would have liked", "[0.4] [Autumn 2020] You'll get the most out of it if you give yourself time to play with the tools you're learning!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] This class is wonderful! Constantin is an excellent instructor, and he managed to make this course interesting and fun even in an online context.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] You should take this class to better understand fundamentals and principles of sound recording. The professor is fantastic and helpful (Constantin) and very knowledgeable. The assignments, though time-consuming, are a treat and always fun to do.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] Super fun and cool community feel/togetherness. This class is very difficult to get into - I think maybe 50 people showed up the first day and only 15 get in. Definitely take 101 first.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2019] Recording feels like one of those topics where there's no better way to learn other than by simply doing. As such, this class gives you all the tools you need. Plus, it's well organized with meaningful assignments.", "[0.35] [Autumn 2019] If you want to learn about recording, take this course. It will offer you all the basics you need to know as well as hands on experience.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2019] Such a great resource for getting your recording off the ground!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] Would definitely recommend applying for this course if you are interested in this kind of thing. I found that having some background experience about sound or recording or how DAWs work was helpful, but you could definitely learn that along the way too.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Take this class!! But try to take music 101 first or be a MST student because it's really tough to get into this class. Elena is super sweet and helpful but Fall 2019 was her first time teaching the class so she wasn't the best teacher. But what's important is that she knows a ton and makes herself accessible so that made the class good. Also, you get out what you put into this class! The more time you spend in the studio, the more you'll learn.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2018] Absolutely take it, it's a relatively low time and schoolwork commitment but you learn a ton. Projects teach a lot and they're graded very forgivingly", "[0.55] [Autumn 2018] Do it, but only if you're really excited about it", "[0.75] [Autumn 2018] All you need to do is want to learn! Never take this class because you \"have\" to - you should want to learn how to use the recording studio. Great class!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] This class is so cool, and highly enjoyable. The thing is, it's really what you make of it. You can get by going to class and spending only 2-3 hours outside of class doing the assignments.  However, you will learn SO much more if you carve out time in your schedule to dig in and spend lots of time there, and I would highly recommend that. Taking this class was so empowering, I just wish I had prioritized it higher over some of my other obligations and really dug in.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2018] Eoin is the man. If you are someone who shows up all the time and puts effort into your work, he will be very generous with his time and provide amazing insights on the various aspects of your songwriting and recording skills.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2018] This is such a valuable course to any student interested in music and sound production.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2018] take it!!!!! Eoin's the best.", "[0.4] [Autumn 2017] Highly recommend it", "[0.75] [Autumn 2017] Take it!! Very interesting and worthwhile course!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2017] Very high reward to time ratio, Jay and Elliott are awesome.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2017] The course is well taught; however, a lot more time is focused on concepts and theory, and we end up spending only a small fraction of time in the studio. I imagine this course and the next course can be combined if they were focused more on the practical.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] Great course for anyone interested in sound engineering / recording.  Jay is full of interesting anecdotes and the opportunity learn how to work in the studio is invaluable!", "[0.0] [Autumn 2017] Go to class and the material will make more sense", "[0.75] [Autumn 2017] Fun! Very, very easy. Physics knowledge is not really at all required, even though it appears to be for the first 1-2 weeks. No math/physics on either exam. Just \"What microphone is this?\", \"What does this circuit that you've literally seen this exact picture of do?\", etc.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2017] This class is very useful if you are interested in the science, history, and/or techniques involved in recording sound & music.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2017] If you'd like to know how to record like a proper sound engineer, definitely take this class. Jay is very experienced and knows everything about the entire history of the field, and you will learn so much just by listening to how he thinks about recording.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2017] Look, if you wanna fulfill your SMA requirement and learn a lot about how to record and handle sound, this is for you. The studio exercises are really fun and rewarding; it's hard to get this much hands-on experience elsewhere. You may not leave the class being the next hit producer, but you'll be a step further on that path.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2017] Great intro to sound engineering if you're interested what goes behind the curtains in a recording studio. From learning the circuits that make up most of studio equipment to actual mixing exercises, this class was a weird, pleasant tour of in and outs of audio engineering. Jay tends to go off tangents and it's easy to falll asleep in lectures. His background, though, is very interesting and the material is full of gems.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2017] This course is for people who love music, and benefits those who have a background in electrical engineering and signal processing and/or physics.  If you're not strong there, definitely get help. Jay is SO willing to help and meet up. Really a hidden gem.", "[0.4] [Autumn 2016] Know that the class is mostly lecture and not too much hands on stuff (there are two studio projects). Technical details are emphasized rather than creativity.", "[0.4] [Autumn 2016] Very nice course, it's just have a hard cap (because we need recording room or exercises), so expect to get kicked out if you are not a music major.", "[0.3] [Autumn 2016] If you find recording engineering a potentially interesting topic, I would not hesitate to take this class. This class isn't intense enough to pose a significant burden on your schedule.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2016] must take for ccrma access", "[0.45] [Autumn 2016] There are two reasons to take this class: either you are very interested in analog recording/electronics, or you are just trying to take 192B/C. If you are taking it for the latter reason, you will probably be very bored by a lot of it, but if you are taking it for the former reason (as I was), you will probably find the lectures very interesting, if sometimes confusing.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2016] We did not spend as much time in the recording studio as I expected. Looking back, this makes sense because we needed to build up our fundamentals before actually recording."], "MUSIC 192B": ["[0.8] [Winter 2019] Great way to get hands on experience in the CCRMA studio and an invaluable opportunity to get feedback on your recording and mixing skills.", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] Great class to learn about mixing, recording.   Also great if you have songs in mind you want to have recorded, since the projects allow you to do just that.", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] Not as organized or fun as 192A but good practice and we had great conversations", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] Eoin is a diamond in the rough-one of the few CCRMA teachers I've found who actually cares about his students and their mastery of the material. I had the best conversations about music that I've ever had in this class with him and my classmates. The highlight of my week.", "[0.85] [Winter 2019] This is a great course. Very hands on and practical. I learned a lot of skills applicable to my production practice, as well as helpful knowledge about the audio industry.", "[0.85] [Winter 2019] if you are self-motivated do it. no one is going to hold you hand through a creative process, which despite the technicalities, is ultimately what it is. engage with the course and you will see the benefits.", "[0.85] [Winter 2018] Great class! A lot of interesting info on recording music and a good exposure to the recording and mixing process.", "[0.8] [Winter 2018] great fun-- start the project early", "[0.65] [Winter 2018] Absolutely a must if you are interested in recording yourself or others or doing mixing/production.  Jay's knowledge is so comprehensive.", "[0.9] [Winter 2018] This class is a great way to gain more experience using CCRMA's recording studio, receive mixing (and some mastering) advice, and learn about the technical mechanics of compressors, ADCs, and audio playback mediums. If you've taken 192A, I highly recommend 192B as well.", "[0.9] [Winter 2017] This is a good platform to understand how sound recording works and how can you make that recording sound even better using key mixing techniques. Make use of the recording studio; it is a wonderful place to be creative and get a professional sound (if done right)", "[0.8] [Winter 2017] Get Jay involved in your projects.  Sitting down/working one on one with him is great.  He is incredibly knowledge and practiced.  When he explains a concept to you, he is patient and incredibly thorough. Thank you Jay", "[0.55] [Winter 2017] Very good class!", "[0.55] [Winter 2017] MUST TAKE! ENJOYED IT SO MUCH", "[0.5] [Winter 2017] Very chill, a lot of fun, try to start your recording project earlier in the quarter so you're able to book time in the studio", "[0.95] [Winter 2017] Great class! Jay is a very relaxed and passionate professor who certainly is remarkably insightful about anything music related", "[0.25] [Winter 2017] Have questions in class, he is a real expert so he will be able to answer them well."], "MUSIC 192C": ["[0.45] [Autumn 2022] Great if you want to do some self-directed recording work. As with any independent study, the lack of structure sometimes made progress slow, but having advice from Hassan and open access to the studio at all hours of the night were both invaluable.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] Take if you have the chance! You get out what you put in. Hassan is great, super knowledgeable, and has lots of great ideas. It's also nice to get/give feedback to your peers.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] This is a great class to continue developing and refining recording techniques, and Hassan is a great professor!", "[0.85] [Spring 2020] super open-ended; great way to set a deadline for yourself (and get as much feedback as you want) for a recording project", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] Yes yes yes yes yes", "[0.65] [Autumn 2019] Do it!!

He will often get sidetracked and as someone who had very little understanding of opera coming into the class, I was often lost during lectures. The midterm was challenging because none of the material tested was on the slides or in the readings, and he asked very open ended questions as multiple choice questions that made the exam very frustrating. I would not recommend this class to anyone who wants to actually learn and not feel dumb for not having a background in art.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] A wonderful class. Professor Grey is great and the teaching is quite engaging with examples. If you pay attention in class, the exams shouldn't be very difficult; all the examples on them are covered in the lecture. Otherwise, the class is chill (not at all time consuming) and the trip to SF Opera is lots of fun.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2022] Nice, easy course.

Thomas Grey is a really fun teacher! The tests are extremely hard, though, so watch out for those.", "[0.35] [Autumn 2022] If you like opera, this is a good class! It is not a class to take without an actual passion. Less opera discussion, more opera being taught to you. There are right and wrong interpretations, and not any debate in this class. This is more of a way to learn about opera, rather than engage with opera in a group.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] I would highly recommend this class to anyone that is even slightly considering taking it. I entered this class with almost 0 knowledge of opera, but it was surprising just how much of the music we covered I recognized. Professor Grey and the teaching staff were incredibly supportive and made the experience of learning more about opera low stress and truly enjoyable.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] This class is great if you are even moderately interested in opera. Not a huge commitment by any means, and Professor Gray is a really chill professor. Exams are take home open-note, so getting a good grade in this class shouldn't be too difficult, making it a great WAYS-AII class.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Before taking this class, I only had a vague idea that opera music sounded cool, but now I feel that I can actually understand and appreciate it more. Tom is amazing, one of the kindest teachers I've ever met, and he's super chill, so take this class even if it's just for him.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2021] It's a pretty fun class without much work but you'll still learn a good amount about opera. Plus you get a free trip to the San Francisco Opera, which was a fun time. Most people are in the class for the WAYS requirement but it's a really chill WAYS class without much work. There is a midterm and final so it's worth paying attention in class and doing some studying for those, and the TA had some really helpful review sessions before the exam (that he was nice enough to record for people who couldn't make it!) so definitely go to those, but if you show up to class and study some for the exams it's a really easy class.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2021] If you have the time, it's helpful and interesting to explore all the content offered by the websites we use to watch operas in class (metopera, medicitv, etc.).", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Great. Interesting and relaxed. You can learn as much as you want. Not too much work. Tom is great.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Professor Grey is wonderful and you learn a great deal about opera. Would recommend this class", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] This class is a lot of fun, and was a great way to fulfill a WAYS requirement. Professor Grey is very lighthearted and enthusiastic about the material, which made me more eager to learn it. The trip to the San Francisco Opera House was very enjoyable. If you pay attention in class and put in effort, it should be an easy A that teaches you a surprising amount about opera and European history. The class tended to lag behind the syllabus and spend more time than expected on certain operas or eras, but I was happy to linger on these productions and feel that this is a class where not all of the material needs to be covered in-depth.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] Great class, Tom is a gem. Definitely take it!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] This is a great course! Professor Grey was amazing and he was so passionate about opera. He also did a great job of making sure the class was involved in his lectures!", "[0.3] [Autumn 2021] I enjoyed watching all of the opera clips in class, but overall the class was a bit repetitive/scattered.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] This is a solid class for surveying opera as an art form. It's a minimal amount of work, and the lectures are not always the most organized but they are still interesting. Getting to see an opera in person is also a real bonus to the class.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] If you interested in opera history and analyzing operatic performances over the decades then take this class. The class is taught based off of slide shows, so the lectures can be a bit slow at times, but the content is very interesting. There is not too much of a work load as well.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] A fantastic class and would definitely recommend anyone to try it out. No music prerequisite needed(I had none) and you can handle the assignments/exams so long as you attend lessons. Fun to watch opera live at the SF opera and a great conversation starter too. Try it if you want a fun change of pace from your usual classes. Prof Grey and Mike(TA) were helpful and knowledgeable.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] Take this class! Professor Grey is amazing. You'll learn about different operas and analyze them. You also learn about the history of opera which is very interesting.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2021] I actually don't like opera and took this class to try and gain an appreciation of it from an academic and cultural perspective. The best part was attending the opera in San Francisco but lectures felt a little all over the place for me. The exams in this class are extremely difficult. I think this class would get more students and probably even more student engagement if the exams and assignments were less strenuous. Thankfully we can take online exams this quarter but if this was in person in a final exam 3hr timeframe I would be even more anxious than I am now.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Great easy course to fulfill WAYS and learn about opera. Try to do the opera trip if possible since it's free.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Pretty good class - if you don't know anything about opera (like me) you'll get an understanding and even have some songs that you listen to in class stuck in your head. The San Francisco Opera trip is also a lot of fun. However, Dr. Grey does like to ramble a bit and the class is a little disorganized.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] Great! You really learn to appreciate opera", "[0.3] [Autumn 2021] Midterm and final take a really, really long time to complete so be prepared for that.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] Low commitment, fun course. Highly recommend you attend the lectures and just listen closely \u2013 doing that with some review of the class material available on Canvas is sufficient for exams.\nThe SF Opera trip is a bonus, but the content is highly engaging too (and this is coming from an international student!)", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] Professor Grey is an incredibly kind and accommodating instructor and really expresses his enthusiasm for opera through this class.", "[0.15] [Autumn 2020] Absolutely 100% take it! This course changed my life and the way I view opera. The only thing I'd be wary of is the number of pre-recorded lectures. If I had one suggestion/critique, it would be to shorten the lectures video, as this course was much more work online than it would have been in-person, I think.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2020] Take this class!! Tom is one of the best professors I've had and clearly knows so much about the subject matter and is a really great person to talk to about it. If you have even an inkling that you enjoy opera, you will love this class and come out of it with a lot of knowledge that you can carry with you in the future, even if you have little background in music like me. One of the best courses I've taken and I'm so excited to continue learning more about this topic after this class, just do it!!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] Take this class! You don't have to know anything about opera but you will learn to appreciate it if nothing else. I looked forward to this class as an awesome change of pace from hard-core academics every week. There is barely any work outside of class and the small amount of work you do have is honestly kind of fun!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] Very interesting and solid course! Class is not too stressful, which helps with learning a lot and watching operas with enjoyment :P", "[0.9] [Autumn 2020] Highly recommend - professor Grey is awesome and will make you appreciate opera :)", "[0.7] [Autumn 2020] I recommend taking it, just make sure you watch the lectures and stay on top of it! Readings optional.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2020] Take this while it's in person! I have a feeling that the quality of the course was affected by the remote nature of this quarter? we didn't get to go see any operas in person. Professor Grey is very understanding and extremely nice! I wish, though, that our classes on Tuesday were in person. It felt like we had to watch a lot of homework each week.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2020] Great course to learn about opera, especially if you don't know anything about it going into the class", "[0.9] [Autumn 2020] Take this class. Professor Grey is great and the material is super interesting", "[0.85] [Autumn 2020] Tom Grey is the best, very kind, and opera is an area I was unfamiliar with, but he made it very accessible and interesting", "[0.8] [Autumn 2019] This is a perfect introduction to opera. It is an easy class to attend as the teacher makes it enjoyable and I don't think it is too rigorous or painful to get a good grade.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2019] This course is disorganized, but it is a very easy class to tack on to any quarter.  If you want a light class with not much work, take it.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] A fantastic course and a fantastic teacher! He has a genuine interest in the subject matter and will answer every and all questions. When he didn't know an answer, he would research and provide us with his findings the next week. Not too much work, but a great experience!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] It's alright but can get a bit boring toward the end of the quarter. Tom is super chill and awesome.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2019] It is a really fun class. It gives you a chance to block out some time to watch operas and enjoy the class without having the stress of not doing well.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Take it! I loved the course. Great way to satisfy AII. It's not too much work and just a chill way to learn something about opera. Tom Grey is hella OG and chillest prof I've ever had. You won't regret it!", "[0.7] [Autumn 2019] This was definitely a chill class, and learned so much about opera. Tom is very understanding and helpful when it comes time for the two papers and exams", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] Really fun class and great AII. The class is pretty much watching scenes and discussing in class, so no real outside work except two 2-page essays", "[0.8] [Autumn 2019] amazing class! youll learn such interesting things youve never thought about", "[0.75] [Autumn 2019] Take it! It's a fabulous class, and it's very laid back. But also, you learn a lot, and after this class, I can confidently say I know a lot about opera.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Tom is a great teacher and really loves opera. I learned a lot and really enjoyed listening to him. Take this course, it's great!", "[0.8] [Autumn 2019] Definitely take it. Great intro to opera!", "[0.45] [Autumn 2019] This is a fun and engaging class. You can make what you want out of in class discussion, but the more you participate, the more you get out of the class.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] This is a great course for all students interested in learning more about opera. It's really interesting material!", "[0.6] [Autumn 2019] midterm and final are decently hard, just pay attention in class and review slides for those. Class is very interesting and you should take opportunity to see the opera with the class.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2019] Best humanities class I've taken!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] wonderful AII class -- Tom is really great and makes every class fun", "[0.0] [Autumn 2017] Take it.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2017] It was a great introduction to a new art form, and Professor Grey's passion for the material comes through in his lectures.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2017] Take it. It is very chill.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] The course lacks structure, but if you just want to appreciate opera music, this course is a great choice", "[0.95] [Autumn 2017] The teacher is very wonderful and quirky. He clearly is passionate about opera and loves talking about it. You definitely have to study for the exams, but if you attend class and listen you should be alright! I liked this class very much.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2017] Absolutely take it! Grey is the typical college professor... salt and pepper hair, uses big words and has very interesting lectures. Be sure to go to the included operas.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2017] Excellent class if you are looking to branch out from boring major requirements. I had never experienced opera before, and taking this class definitely made me feel more cultured and aware of this spectacular art form.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2017] Love is the heartbeat of the universe! Mysterious, exalted, Torture and delight to the heart.", "[0.25] [Autumn 2017] Take this class! It's extremely interesting. The tests are kinda killer but if you go to class and listen you'll do fine.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] This is a fun course, and you definitely learn a lot! It is interesting with a reasonable amount of work for three units, would definitely recommend.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2017] This is a really wonderful class with fantastic instruction! Professor Grey is a wonderful teacher who keeps lecture engaging and fun. The trips to the opera in SF are superb! Overall, would very much recommend.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2017] Really cool intro course and a fun way to fulfill a WAYS requirement. It makes opera a lot more accessible and enjoyable.  We saw 2 operas for free! Grey is really knowledgeable and enthusiastic, if a bit disorganized.  Minimal work involved--two short (2-3 page) papers, two in-class exams with no official final.  Exams are a mix of fill-in-the-blank, short answer, and music identification.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2017] Great class- Tom Grey is a great instructor who is very passionate about what he's teaching, and certainly cares about his students' learning.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2017] Interesting intro to opera course. good selection of time periods and reasonable work load.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2017] To anyone interested in learning a little bit more about opera, this class is for you! To a degree, you get out what you put in. It's actually pretty fun being able to talk about opera now...", "[0.8] [Autumn 2017] Professor Grey is a little disorganized, but the class is interesting and a lot of fun.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2016] Start studying for the midterm and final at least a week beforehand-I put at least 10 hours into studying for each, which resulted in <U on my best exam. Music ID's are extremely tough- must have an excellent ear for music and have the elements to each scene of each act nailed. Keep in mind, we studied 10-15 operas and each had 30-40 scenes. Have opera playing on your headphones 24/7, whether at the dining hall or at the gym.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2016] Great class. Do it to learn a lot about Opera, even if you've never been interested in Opera before.", "[0.3] [Autumn 2016] Make sure to go to whichever opera the class attends in san francisco.", "[0.4] [Autumn 2016] definitely take it", "[0.0] [Autumn 2016] It's mostly just a lax course about opera. A few papers and exams, but nothing much. You can get a lot out of this course if you look into the individual operas themselves. The instructor is also very knowledgeable about the topic.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2016] definitely take. Any major!", "[0.4] [Autumn 2016] Important to stay on top of the listening examples; not really something you can cram for the night before the exam", "[0.5] [Autumn 2016] Good Class if you want to know more about Opera.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2016] A great introduction to a myriad of popular operas but nothing too in-depth", "[0.4] [Autumn 2016] This is definitely a class where I learned things that I will keep for life."], "MUSIC 20A": ["[0.85] [Autumn 2022] I like Jazz. This class will make you understand and also like Jazz. By the end you will be able to compose your own basic jazz melodies, baselines, and even 12-bar-blues. The class moves a little slowly and chill. James Nadel is an awesome instructor.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2022] This is a surprisingly demanding class, with assignments due almost every class. However, each assignment is quite manageable and they're generally very fun to do if you're into jazz. I definitely learned a lot.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2022] Take it! Jim is super nice and class is chill", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] This is a great course. A great introduction into the world of jazz that doesn't require too much work, and Jim's passion is quite contagious.", "[0.05] [Autumn 2022] Take this class if you need a refresher of beginner jazz theory and some jazz tools like listening. Could be boring if you're beyond the beginner level.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2022] Start assignments early. You'll get out of this class what you put in", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] This class was very fun. Classes were always a pleasure to attend and assignments were great opportunities to apply what was discussed during lecture. Take this class if you have any interest in learning more about jazz and a reasonable background in music theory!", "[0.0] [Autumn 2022] Even if you aren't a jazz musician, this class is very approachable for anyone.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] Really great class! Highly recommend if you like jazz and are just looking to gain a better understanding. Sometimes the lectures can be a bit challenging to follow if you have a less formal music theory background.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2022] Jim is very accommodating of late work and other complications, but you should keep on top of your work because he might play your piece in class! (And it\u2019s difficult to play catch up if you don\u2019t)", "[0.75] [Autumn 2022] It's fun, and is a good intro to jazz.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] If you have any interest or knowledge of music theory, I highly recommend this class! The workload is very manageable, and at the end, you get good exposure to some jazz classics as well as how to write your own jazz tunes. Jim is a super fun instructor and every class is just a good time listening to his stories.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] This is a great intro to jazz theory. Professor Nadel is a great lecturer and is very insightful. In addition to learning about chord progressions, Professor Nadel started each class by playing music that each student recommended, introducing me to a plethera of different genres that I have learned to love. You should definitely take this class", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] This was such an interesting class! The workload is however much you want to get out of it; in theory it's listed as 3 units but in practice the assignments were always super fun to complete so it didn't feel like real work (coming from a non-music major who took the class for fun). The end of the quarter does ramp up a bit so beware of that if you're considering this course during a busy quarter.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Definitely take it, Jim is a wonderful lecturer who knows a lot of jazz and has great stories to tell.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2021] Very chill class", "[0.2] [Autumn 2021] A good intro to jazz theory! The assignments honestly took me a long time, since you have to compose music while paying attention to a lot of jazz rules. I think if I continue studying jazz, this will be a good starting point, but I don't feel super secure in the knowledge that I just gained.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] This class introduced me to a lot of great music. It's a very fun and chill class and I learned a lot about the technicalities of jazz music. I highly recommend it!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Jim is awesome. He fills class with stories about musicians, listens to jazz with the class, and deeply respects that the class is comprised of jazz prodigies as well as total jazz newbies. Super chill. You'll feel like you didn't learn a ton, but when you look back you realize Jim imparted tons of knowledge, but he does it so casually you don't even realize how much you're walking away with. An ideal class for jazz fans and people who want to become jazz fans.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Definitely take it! Great intro to chords, chord progressions, and harmonic analysis. Also, Jim Nadel is so kind and knowledgeable.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] This class is amazing! I think this might have been my favorite class at Stanford. If you're at all interested in jazz (and have the background equivalent to about MUSIC 19B), TAKE IT! It's excellent, and hearing Jim Nadel tell stories is a must-have experience.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Jim is a great professor and this is a fairly laid back class. The content is a great introduction to jazz, especially for someone who might just be getting into it/interested in starting playing and understanding the analytical background. Lots of chances to listen to jazz in class, and Jim frequently has fun anecdotes about jazz greats that are a good way of supplementing the base information of the class. The workload does pile up toward the end of the semester if you don't keep on top of it, though; there are 3 or 4 long-term projects that are all due in the last week.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2020] This course is pretty fun! Despite technical difficulties in the beginning, the instructor quickly figured out how to  juggle playing audio from various sources on Zoom, and the rest of the course was smooth sailing. Class might feel a little repetitive with how much Roman numeral analysis is done on different charts and how often ii-V-Is are covered, but there is value in repetition and there is something new to learn on each chart. Jim also tells fun stories!", "[0.7] [Autumn 2020] I would say that this course is very laid back and that it useful because jazz should be an enjoyable thing", "[0.8] [Autumn 2020] Take it if you are interested in jazz theory or learning more about jazz. Jim is quite passionate about the content and knows a lot and teaches quite well. Jim initially struggled with the Zoom, but once he got the hang of it, the class became a lot better", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] This is a fantastic course. If you are new to music theory you can still enjoy it and learn a lot. I thought the course was very enjoyable and the professor is great!", "[0.0] [Autumn 2020] This course is fundamental to your jazz introduction and foundation.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] Nadel is chill and funny and the class is great and relaxed.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] If you're at all interested in jazz, take this course with Professor Nadel. Very easy going professor who is also extremely knowledgeable. Great guy, good jokes, and fantastic course overall.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2019] Great course, you learn a lot and get to listen to a lot of cool jazz", "[0.6] [Autumn 2019] Super chill class, especially with a background in music", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] a fantastic introduction to music theory for someone with very little experience much more interested in jazz and other popular music and less interested in classical music theory. also story time with Jim Nadel makes my day every time :)", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] Please do! Jim is a wonderful teacher and player, and I guarantee you won't regret it", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Didn't go as far in depth or high-level as I would have hoped - spent a lot of time on the blues, but it was easy and fun and a great excuse to listen to music !", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] Great course for learning jazz. James is a great teacher and passionate about what he does", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] Great class! Jim is amazing", "[0.75] [Autumn 2018] It's a ton of fun and honestly quite a light class, though you will learn and listen to a ton. Take it!", "[0.1] [Autumn 2018] The official requirement of this course is MUSIC 19 but if you do not have musical background that goes beyond you would have trouble truly understanding some of the materials taught in class", "[0.25] [Autumn 2018] This course can be helpful but only if you take the time to apply what you're learning outside of class on an instrument.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2018] An interesting class.  Take it if you are at all interested in jazz music or theory.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2018] It's a great introduction to jazz theory. You will definitely learn a lot.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] Very chill course and, while having prior jazz knowledge definitely feels like it would help to maximize what you get out of the course, it's approachable to students with a non-existent jazz background and limited theory understanding. I wish I had taken more ear training before this class however, it is the one thing that would have helped me get the most out the course", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] Nadel is a a very enthusiastic instructor who has a good ear for jazz and equally impressive stories about the jazz world. Don't expect to learn too much classical-style theory. You'll work on listening and writing skills instead.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] It's great fun. You learn a bit about jazz theory (which is mainly ii-V-I) and a lot of random funny stories and jokes related to jazz", "[0.75] [Autumn 2018] Pretty fun, you get to listen to, analyze and compose jazz. It can be a bit slow at times.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] This is a really fun, relaxed introduction to jazz harmony and other aspects of jazz. Jim does a really good job of ensuring that people of any background can get something out of the class, but I think it's probably best to have a little bit of understanding of tonal harmony beforehand.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] Great course! A bit slow paced if you have a strong music background, but Jim is an awesome instructor with a lot of great stories.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2018] Ya like jazz? Take it. Between analyzing jazz standards and Jim's witty sense of humor, you'll have a blast.", "[-0.25] [Autumn 2017] Gives you a good understanding of some seminal jazz works but will not help you too much in learning how to improvise", "[0.8] [Autumn 2017] Course felt too slow paced for me (classically trained musician with basic understanding of jazz). Nonetheless, the material is interesting and Nadel is an awesome professor.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2017] Take the course if you are interested in learning jazz. This course was a great way to transition from classical music to jazz.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] This is a great course for people who are interested in jazz. Professor Nadel really wants his students to succeed and wants to encourage them as much as possible.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2017] Pretty relaxed course, and there's definitely a lot to learn if you're not familiar with jazz", "[0.6] [Autumn 2017] Nadel is a great instructor and very accomodating for students with all types of music backgrounds. This is a great course to start learning jazz theory in, especially if you have music experience but maybe not theory experience.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2017] It's a nice class but more work than expected. Professor Nadel is fun but meanders a lot", "[0.6] [Autumn 2017] I would recommend this course for any musician and anyone who is a fan of jazz.", "[0.5] [Autumn 2017] If you're interested in jazz, definitely take this class. It's accessible to people with no real knowledge of music theory other than reading notes. Jim is also such a character with so many stories that you really just need to take this class.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2017] Do take this class!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] Would recommend. Jazz itself is hard but Professor Nadel is super chill and very understanding. It's one of those classes where you get as much out of it as you put in so only take it if you're actually interested in learning about jazz.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2017] Start on the compositions early -- you get out what you put in.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2017] If you are at all interested in jazz and want to learn more about how it works, I highly recommend this class. Jim is such a hilarious instructor and often tells tangential stories that make class a fun time (although lecture tend to be a bit unpredictable, disorganized as a result). We get to listen to and analyze a lot of jazz standards and classic solos, and the composition assignments are quite fun as well. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great chill class to add to your schedule!", "[0.4] [Autumn 2017] It is helpful if you have experience listening to jazz music before taking this class.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2017] Definitely take this course if you are at all interested in learning more about jazz. Jim's approach is extremely intuitive, and his insight and stories are not to be forgotten.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2017] Very chill class. Surprisingly fun to write music. You can get away with being tone deaf to a degree.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2017] I loved this class! Much easier if you have some music theory background (I had taken piano lessons and was in choir before Stanford) so you can focus on learning the jazz specific concepts. Classes were fun, and I have much more appreciation for the jazz I hear now. You do have to do weekly assignments, but if you enjoy making music then it doesn't feel like much of a burden.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2017] You have got to take this course. Jim is such an engaging professor, an amazing storyteller, spectacular teacher, and compassionate human. The class is so much fun and has a live performance aspect (that he's super supportive about if you don't want to do it in the front of the class), he plays your homework pieces on his saxophone, and just makes the class a welcome environment every time.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2017] DO IT.  You'll learn a lot about music, and you'll have a blast learning from Jim", "[0.9] [Autumn 2016] it's definitely worth it if you want to learn the basics of jazz. have some knowledge about music theory before hand if you want to have an easier time.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2016] It's a good course for learning jazz theory and the concepts are very interesting, but the lectures aren't the most engaging.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2016] Take the course if you enjoy jazz or want to be introduced to it! Jim is a great instructor.", "[0.35] [Autumn 2016] I feel conflicted about this class; Jim is a really cool guy and he knows his stuff, but I don't feel like he's great at teaching it. He tends to talk at you for the whole class, and it can be difficult to absorb the material. This class requires very little work, but I can't say I learned too much from it", "[0.55] [Autumn 2016] It's fun! Practice the course evaluations", "[0.4] [Autumn 2016] Take it! You will not regret it", "[0.3] [Autumn 2016] go to class, actively listen to the listening cd he gave us", "[0.9] [Autumn 2016] Take this awesome class!

Everyone from someone who only knows the notes on a scale to a professional jazz musician will learn to be better in this class.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2016] The course is very fun if you like music or jazz music. The assignments help you learn a lot. Lecture also has some very good material, but often I felt like I was wasting my time because the material was presented sort of slowly, there were too many technical issues with the projector and/or the instructor went off-topic. But overall, it was one of the most pleasant courses I've taken at Stanford, because I'm very interested in the subject.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2016] It is an excellent introduction to jazz theory and really helps you to both gain an introduction to your jazz repertoire and develop your ability to critically analyze a jazz composition.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2016] Great introduction to ideas in Jazz theory; relaxed class overall; material is presented in a straightforward and fun manner.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2016] It's a great class, and Jim is an awesome guy.

You just get to spend a couple hours a week hanging out with a bunch of people that love jazz music.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2016] This is a great class if you have a little music background and are interested at all in jazz! You learn a lot of theory while listening to great music and getting the chance to apply the theory to compositions."], "MUSIC 20B": ["[1.0] [Winter 2021] Didn't have a ton of jazz experience or knowledge before this class, but I loved it and learned so much--vocabulary, idioms, approaches, and mindsets. Definitely would take again. Jim is great and is quite understanding! Very chill, approachable class that is centered on the appreciation and understanding of music. Some of the assignments, including the final project, took some time, but it was AWESOME to hear them played by professional musicians. Also, here's a fun party trick: memorize A440!", "[0.75] [Winter 2021] fantastic course highly recommend", "[1.0] [Winter 2021] This is a great course for diving more into the jazz idiom and continuing to feel comfortable with the breadth and (what seems like) complexity of modern jazz theory. We touch on important concepts including writing a bass line, writing a new melody over common changes (Rhythm and blues), and creating our own ii-V-I's with a variety of alterations. This helped me feel a lot more comfortable with the theory through repeated exposure, and of course Jim is a great instructor with lots of passion for jazz. The final project is a great to go more in depth in a topic that interests you. Highly recommend!", "[0.45] [Winter 2021] This class is wonderful. You can learn a lot just by existing in this class, Professor Nadel makes everything very accessible and the class is really laid back.

Throughout the class, different lecturers with different methodologies are brought in to teach. This gives a wide variety of approaches and ideas for composing music.", "[0.5] [Spring 2022] Fun class. Heavily geared toward jazz band rather than concert music or acapella", "[1.0] [Spring 2022] This is a great and intimate way to learn instrumental arranging for people of any experience level. The guest speakers present really powerful ideas and are amazing musicians in their own respect\u2014we're lucky to be around them!

The flexibility in content for the final project is also very helpful for integrating the project into a broader project, or exploring a potential topic for future research. Dr. G is an astute pedagogue and facilitated a collegial atmosphere in which all the students quickly learned of each other's intellectual dispositions, readily contributed discussion points arising from these viewpoints, and felt comfortable asking the kind of questions one often prefaces with \"This might be a stupid question but ...\" (the point is we did readily ask!).

I guess the one criticism (which he would probably admit to too) is that the class makes you follow rules, but it's not like we're advanced enough to not follow them either. I guess the point I'm trying to make is it can come off as rigid, but the class is fun. Giancarlo's a great person and makes the class fun.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] Giancarlo is a wonderful instructor! I learned so much about the basics of music theory. The homework level was quite manageable so this is a good class to take alongside an otherwise heavy course load. If you have a solid musical background (ex. did band or orchestra in high school) you will probably be at a good level for this class.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] Giancarlo is a wonderful professor. He teaches in a very enthusiastic and easy-to-follow way. I love the way he approaches music. Moreover, Music 21 is wonderful. It is not too difficult, but it reinforces the basics of music theory and harmonic progressions that we often forget in the advanced music we hear these days. It is a great class to take in companion with Music 24A - they really feed off each other well.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] The material is a little dry, but Giancarlo is an enthusiastic lecturer and it's really cool to watch him compose. Definitely take this if you're interested in a bit more hands-on learning --- a lot of practice with voice leading, chord progressions, and basic composing with that.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2022] Great intro to music theory! Giancarlo makes music theory (which can get boring at times) very interesting.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2022] Giancarlo is a wonderful professor, and explains the concepts very well.

I'm not a music major, but I'd taken some theory before, and this class was a lot of fun. Keep in mind that it is quite theoretical, so you don't spend a lot of time in class hearing the concepts applied. Once or twice as examples, yes, but I wish I'd taken more time out of class to practice. Giancarlo is a great instructor, and is clearly passionate about what he does. He makes class fun.", "[1.0] [Winter 2022] I really enjoyed Erik's teaching style for the first class or two, because he would go off on interesting tangents and ramble about corners of music theory, but pretty quickly that turned into class feeling unfulfilling and feeling like I wasn't getting much out of lecture. For most of the class, lecture was just a more verbose recounting of the material in the textbook, so I sometimes felt better about the material after having read the textbook than after sitting in lecture. That being said, I do think all of the homeworks Erik assigned from the textbook did push me to learn the material quite well, and I have a much more solid foundational understanding of harmony now. Overall, would recommend.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] I had very little music theory background, so I studied intervals, cadences, etc. a bit before the class.

Erik and Engin are both awesome and always available to get help, though I did feel some lectures droned on longer than they needed to. Others I felt deserved more time. We follow the book to a tee, though, so just reading the book makes it easy to catch up. Also, the homework can take a lot longer than you may expect for a 3-unit class, but other nights feel way lighter. Major takeaway is some aspects of music theory just take more time to grasp, but I do think this course is a great starting point. Ultimately, you will find that you have absorbed all of the content and feel accomplished at the end!", "[-0.75] [Winter 2022] This class was dreadfully boring and disorganized because there was no Canvas page.

If you like music theory, do it!", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] This class follows a book pretty closely, and the readings are pretty helpful when it comes time to do the homework assignment.

Giancarlo is one of the funniest professors I've ever had,  class was extremely informative, and I feel like I have a much better grasp on the \"rules\" of classical music that tell us what sounds \"good\". There are worksheet assignments due before each class that only take an hour or two and help you apply the theory learned in class.

I tested out of this course in the beginning of the year but took it anyways, Giancarlo is a great teacher and very funny.

I now listen to music completely differently and have a much greater appreciation for it.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2019] If you are interested in music take it; however, it would also depend on how much theory you've done in the past and the level of challenge you are looking for in that regard.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Giancarlo makes seemingly dry material kind of fun. The pace of the class is really reasonable and they give you lots of second chances to get credit for HW. Giancarlo is hilarious and class often felt like stand-up comedy.

As someone who's played an instrument for a long time but didn't really know any music theory, this course a fun chance to learn more about things that I kind of took for granted before. If you have some musical background (but no theory background) the course is very manageable with 2 lectures   2 short hw assignments (30-60 mins each) per week plus take-home midterm and final. The hardest part for me was the fact that I can't really play piano so playing through some of the hw exercises can be kind of tricky. Also I highly recommend taking with Giancarlo.

Great class to learn how different chords function, although you spend a lot of time on voice leading for writing four part chorales", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] Boring class honestly, but not the fault of Talya or the TA. They are great teachers and people in general. Just the course content is boring, but necessary for future theory classes. Take if you're set on pursuing music further, otherwise maybe consider 19A or B", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] Music 21 is a great class.

However, it is mostly review of AP theory, so if you have already taken that, you probably won't need it.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2018] I took this course to fulfill a music certificate requirement, but I enjoyed it so much! I was a bit scared after the first day because I had never done music theory before, but this became one of my least stressful classes! There is so much support, and both the midterm and final are take-home exams. Giancarlo is hilarious, very fun to be in class with. I feel inspired to work more on music theory on my own, since I see how it can be helpfully applied.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] Such a great class!

Giancarlo is amazing and funny.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2018] Giancarlo is an incredibly fun professor. Even though he's a little blunt about errors, he's always trying to teach and make sure that everyone does well.

If you've always had the pull to engage more in music (listening, writing) because you feel the emotions in music, this is THE class for you. 19B gives you an intro to the basic terminologies, but 21 is where you will get the true understanding of tonal music and how they're written. Once you take this course, you will be tempted to be a music major", "[0.8] [Winter 2018] I really enjoyed this class. We learned a lot of cool concepts and it provides a really cool new way of analyzing music.", "[0.95] [Winter 2018] Please take this course! Professor Ulman does a fantastic job of explaining and presenting the theory behind music. At times, he challenges you, but those challenges are always accompanied by wholehearted encouragement. Throughout this course, you will gain the discipline and expressive quality needed in a musician\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work. Embark on a musical journey with Professor Ulman!", "[0.0] [Winter 2018] Very minimal work for a large amount of knowledge. Ulman gets through a lot of quality stuff.", "[0.0] [Winter 2018] You'll get out what you put into it.", "[0.3] [Winter 2018] The course is pretty slow-moving for the most part. That is a blessing when the homework isn't very challenging and a curse when you sit through 1 hr of discussion of passing tones. However, I did learn a lot by taking the class.", "[0.85] [Winter 2018] It's a great class. As long as you can pass the entrance exam, everything needed is taught. So useful, even for a non-music major!", "[0.0] [Winter 2018] Emphasis on classical music", "[0.75] [Winter 2018] Appreciate it! Erik's a fantastic teacher.", "[0.95] [Winter 2018] Erik is an excellent and engaging instructor. Textbook is an excellent source since we follow it closely. Homework can be quite long some time, but it's great in helping understand the concepts.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2017] Music 21 is the intro to a very interesting and compelling set of courses. Definitely take it if you're at all interested in classical theory.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2017] It's not an introductory course, so you should at least know your intervals and how to read music before taking this class. However, the pace is not too fast and it shouldn't be hard to secure a good grade.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2017] Giancarlo is a good teacher--this is a good class to learn the fundamentals in", "[0.85] [Autumn 2017] The class is both enjoyable and educational. Even if one is not planning to go into deeper music studies, I would recommend this course as a fun way to broaden one's exposure to different academic fields.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] Giancarlo is a humorous professor with continually impressive mastery of the course material! Lectures can seem a bit long, but Giancarlo's jokes make them more enjoyable.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2017] This was my favorite course of the term! Really fascinating to learn about if you are a musician", "[0.5] [Autumn 2017] The class is pretty straightforward. Just apply the rules you learn in class, and you'll always get everything correct.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] Giancarlo makes lecture interesting and exciting, and he teaches the material very well. Would definitely help if you have some music theory background coming in. Don't be afraid to ask questions about the material or the homework.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2017] If your grasp on music theory is solid, this class shouldn't be very difficult. (especially if you've taken AP Music Theory before -- then all you need to do is adjust to Giancarlo's rules) The harmonization can be fairly time-consuming, but the work needed for this class shouldn't exceed 10 hours a week.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] This course will teach you a great core of fundamental musical skills. Giancarlo is engaging and extremely knowledgable, and makes the assignments difficult but rewarding. Much more time-consuming than I expected, but definitely teaches a ton of material in just one quarter.", "[0.35] [Autumn 2017] Teaches you important theory/rules for voice leading. My main problem with the class is that there are no course notes/handouts. This makes it hard for information to be organized, and makes the voice leading assignments challenging (and probably leads to more mistakes in the voice leading).   That being said, Giancarlo and the TA want you to succeed. But the path to success is an uphill climb due to the lack of resources/notes.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2017] Professor Aquilanti is fun and engaging.", "[0.4] [Autumn 2017] This class is so great--it really takes your music comprehension skills to the next level. If you're interested in learning about how music is written, this is the class to take.", "[0.6] [Winter 2017] Depending on your prior music experience this course could be somewhat time consuming with homework, but if you have significant experience reading music then learning the concepts isn't too difficult", "[0.7] [Winter 2017] It's a good introduction to tonal harmony.", "[0.45] [Winter 2017] This is a good course if you do not know much about chord progressions or voice leading.", "[0.75] [Winter 2017] It's just the basics but it's great to kearn", "[0.85] [Winter 2017] Professor Ulman is extremely articulate and all-around an amazing lecturer. He makes parallels between music and many universal truths, and his lecture style is inspirational.", "[0.55] [Winter 2017] You should take this! Prepare to spend quite some time on homework but Eric and Nick are extremely supportive and patient. They really are there for your learning.", "[0.75] [Winter 2017] Prof. Ulman is very nice and helps you to grow as a student of music!", "[0.45] [Autumn 2016] I'd like to tell students that it is a great course to take if you want to improve your music theory, but you have to always check their work carefully because you may find mistakes you wouldn't otherwise notice.", "[-0.3] [Autumn 2016] Take it with Giancarlo if possible, and prepare to be challenged if you have limited music theory experience.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2016] Giancarlo is an amazing instructor - he gets his material across in just the right way to make everything interesting.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2016] This course is very enlightening and the material is presented in an animated and engaging way by the instructor.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2016] This course is a good introduction to basic music theory. A lot of ground is covered in one quarter, but it's manageable and the topics are explained well.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2016] Fun class, I recommend 100%!", "[0.6] [Autumn 2016] Giancarlo is absolutely amazing. Try taking it with him if possible.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2016] Anyone wanting to learn music theory should take this class.  Professor Giancarlo Aquilanti is a good professor and is very knowledgeable.", "[0.35] [Autumn 2016] This was a great music theory class. It went a little slowly, but it meant we learned things thoroughly.", "[-0.75] [Autumn 2016] If you can take it with prof. Aquilanti, do so! Nothing is more entertaining than an angry Italian explaining music theory. Classes were enrapturing, and I couldn't look away!", "[0.75] [Autumn 2016] It is one of the better courses I have taken.  Prof. Aquilanti has really inspired me to study and practice music more, especially since lately I have been on the fence about continuing studying it.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2016] it is a very fun course because the instruction is great", "[0.95] [Autumn 2016] Giancarlo is an awesome professor, and he makes learning music theory (a boring subject for some) tons of fun. Would recommend this class to anyone interested in better understanding music conventions!", "[0.5] [Autumn 2016] The professor knows how to work with students and makes the class fun", "[0.7] [Autumn 2016] If you're interested in theory, this is a good starting place.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2016] I love Professor Giancarlo, he is very knowledgeable about music and very passionate and funny in class"], "MUSIC 22": ["[0.8] [Spring 2022] The course is a bit disorganized at times, but the flip side is that it is quite flexible. Given the small class size, it is easy for the professor to adapt to the proficiency of the students. That said, lectures can be quite boring and are often unnecessary to attend (save for the participation grade).", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] It's a fun class. Although, I do wish it focused less on choral writing. Writing chorals was pretty much the focus of the class.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] The material in this course is really good even if you aren't a classical musician. Highly recommend this series to any musician who can fit in the units. IMO it is less than 3 units of work (most time consuming aspect is the class itself) however if you want to write really nice things for the assignments, you can spend more time on it.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] Great class. Giancarlo is a great teacher.", "[0.55] [Winter 2022] It is really hard to catch up once you miss a class or two, so make sure to read the book along with the course and make a friend who can catch you up on content.", "[0.5] [Winter 2022] Music22 with Giancarlo was a class I always looked forward to. I was always inspired by the way he expressed musical concepts and put them in perspective on the piano. His piano improvisation was always on point.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] It's an amazing build on of Music 21, and Giancarlo is great. Take it!", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] If you're remotely interested in music theory, I highly recommend taking the music 20 series. Professor Aquilanti is a fantastic instructor, and while I already knew a good deal of the material covered in this class, I still feel like I learned a lot and class was never boring.", "[0.65] [Winter 2022] You have to take music classes with Giancarlo Aquilante, he is the best professor and character you\u2019ll meet at Stanford.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Take this course with Professor Aquilanti! He is so engaging and makes learning music so interesting and fun!", "[0.65] [Winter 2022] When you say music theory, you probably think about how nerdy and boring it is, but Giancarlo made this one of my most fun classes of the quarter.", "[0.0] [Winter 2022] Absolutely take this course.", "[1.0] [Winter 2021] This class is great for musicians seeking greater understanding about the music they are playing - understanding the theory makes sight-reading and preparing music significantly easier. The class is fun and great way to find friends with a shared interest in music.", "[0.45] [Winter 2021] This is a good course to take if you are invested into knowing more about the strategies employed in compositions.", "[1.0] [Winter 2021] Giancarlo is plain hilarious. His jokes are admittedly stale but that's what makes them so amazing. Easily the most entertaining professor I've had at Stanford and really cares about his students. Fostered an amazing class atmosphere over Zoom. Don't you make the mistake of writing augmented seconds (if you need to know why, he can tell you!)", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] The Music 21/22/23 series is essential for furthering your compositional and performance abilities, so I absolutely recommend taking them as early as possible, as the harmonic fundamentals you develop in these courses paves the way for more advanced courses in theory and composition.\n\n\n\nIf you already have knowledge of basic harmony and voice leading, you can test out of Music 21 by taking a short placement test.\n\n\n\nThe hardest part of this class is constructing your own chord progressions with proper voice leading, so be prepared to spend some time memorizing functions and resolutions of chromatic harmonies!", "[1.0] [Winter 2021] Great class, especially if you are interested in improving your part-writing skills and continuing to learn harmony. Assignments are not very long but are effective in practicing what's learned in class. Definitely can skip Music 21 with AP Music Theory background. Dr. Aquilanti is funny and awesome!", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] Goatcarlo is a great lecturer. 22 is essentially the same as 21, although the voice leading exercises are more difficult. However, near the end of the course we got more freedom in composing our own short pieces, and could even do piano pieces instead of the (annoying) voice leading. Overall, 22 is a really supportive, positive, fun environment and class!", "[0.15] [Winter 2021] Don't forget parallel fifths and augmented seconds", "[0.65] [Winter 2021] Highly recommended, Giancarlo is the GOAT. You will get an appreciation for more colorful musical/composition techniques than you would have from just 21.", "[0.9] [Winter 2021] Definitely take it. I usually don't understand music theory but Giancarlo makes it super easy!", "[0.85] [Winter 2021] This course delves into the ins and outs of tonal music and is overall very interesting! I recommend this course to anyone who is interested in analyzing and writing tonal pieces.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] Interesting material, somewhat similar to AP Music Theory/CM testing curriculum. Giancarlo is good, very knowledgeable and super good at playing on demand. Makes class interesting!", "[0.1] [Winter 2021] Be prepared to compose a lot more. The class is not just identifying chords and progressions but also writing them in your own pieces.", "[0.45] [Winter 2021] Good course", "[0.75] [Winter 2021] Review your notes before doing the homework assignments, it causes you to remember the material much better! Also have fun with the compositions.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] One of the best classes I've taken. Giancarlo is amazing, as usual, and the course content is super interesting, particularly if you enjoyed MUSIC 21.", "[-0.35] [Spring 2020] I wouldn't recommend the online format. I feel like I learned less because of it, and the lectures were sometimes frustrating because we couldn't really interact together and have productive discussions.", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] It will improve your understanding of modulation/secondary functions! The course starts out a little slow with seventh chords but gets more interesting near the end with chromatic chords. Very helpful in improving analysis skills and definitely gets more interesting than the basics of 21.", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] Great class! Talya cares about the students' learning and is a very kind person. At the end of the quarter, I feel able to understand so many more piano pieces (eg. many of Chopin's waltzes) than before the quarter.", "[0.75] [Spring 2019] Prof Rose is a great teacher and the class is very well organized.", "[0.6] [Spring 2019] Dr. Rose moved at a very quick pace, but he is well worth your time. You will get a lot out of this course", "[0.65] [Spring 2019] Come prepared, but absolutely take it if you're interested in music and want to learn more about it.", "[0.9] [Spring 2019] If you see that Francois is teaching a theory class you MUST take it. He's a joy: a fabulous lecturer and a vibrant personality", "[0.85] [Spring 2019] This is Francois's first time teaching the class and he is such a captivating instructor. He's lively, funny, and nice and makes the learning exciting. The assignments are quite difficult, so don't sleep on them, but you'll learn so much and his appreciation for music will seep into every student over the quarter.", "[0.85] [Winter 2019] It's fun! A good way to spend Tues/Thur  with a funny professor!", "[0.65] [Winter 2019] First off, bias check: I've learned the material before and just need to take the class for the major.  Review: Fun teacher. The content starts off slow and really rushes at the end, for whatever reason. Most of the assignments are easy, but a few (the individual compositions) will take time and thought. A little disorganized in terms of handling homework and papers. The workbook is good to have but the textbook not so much. Beware of discrepancies in musical interpretation between this and its \"companion course\" Ear Training. The participation grade is weighted heavily.", "[0.6] [Winter 2019] Awesome course.", "[-0.6] [Winter 2019] Giancarlo has a very unique style of teaching that not all students are accustomed to. Be ready to receive harsh criticism, and be accepting of the fact that you're probably very much in the wrong.", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] This is a great course!  Giancarlo is a very good instructor and also extremely humorous.  The workload is quite light as well.", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] This class is great, especially with Giancarlo teaching it. Even if you aren't a music major, this class is very helpful.", "[0.75] [Winter 2019] Giancarlo is just Giancarlo, but he's great.", "[0.7] [Winter 2019] You have to at least take this class if you want to say you understand a large portion of the tonal music extant. This is THE music class that will help you become a better musician.", "[0.5] [Winter 2019] Good Class, Giancarlo is fun to work with. 22 is significantly harder than 21 but not impossibly so. T", "[0.15] [Spring 2018] Interesting material, although the course is a bit disorganized", "[-0.6] [Spring 2018] The course is well-paced and very manageable. Probably difficult if you lack a lot of music experience.", "[1.0] [Spring 2018] Please take it! Professor Berger is an insightful and enthusiastic lecturer, making concepts easy to understand and the material fun to learn. She emphasizes the importance of applying concepts and theories learned in lectures to formal analysis and musical examples. Professor Berger also assigns engaging exams and projects which allow you to take creative risks in composition. She is encouraging, understanding, and a true pleasure to be around.", "[0.8] [Spring 2018] This is a relatively well-taught course and super interesting material!", "[0.75] [Spring 2018] I can't say enough good things about this course. Talya is an excellent instructor who brings out the best in each student. Would take this class 11 times out of 10", "[0.6] [Winter 2018] Giancarlo is an amazing professor!", "[0.9] [Winter 2018] Highly recommend if interested in deeper music theory. Fun and engaging class.", "[-0.15] [Winter 2018] Giancarlo is a god, under no circumstances will you regret taking this class and you will become a music deity easily", "[0.9] [Winter 2018] If you enjoyed MUSIC 21, you will probably enjoy this course--perhaps even more than 21, as you begin to learn techniques that add more freedom to your part-writing exercises.", "[0.75] [Winter 2018] Take it! Giancarlo is entertaining and the homework is very hands on. This class teaches skills that are useful to any type of musician.", "[0.85] [Winter 2018] I love this course and I love Giancarlo", "[0.85] [Winter 2018] Definitely take it! It's basically 21, but with more advanced (and interesting) concepts.", "[1.0] [Winter 2018] A great follow-up to MUSIC 21. The material is a lot more fun, there is room for creativity in the composition assignments, and the instruction by Giancarlo is great as always. I found the homework assignments to be slightly harder than those of last quarter, but that might just be because I'm a trash piano player. As a non-major, this class was a bit of work but super interesting. Initially, I only intended to take 21, but the great instruction has convinced me to take the whole sequence!", "[0.8] [Winter 2018] So much more interesting than Music 21 (which was great too!)", "[0.85] [Winter 2018] This is a must-take class for anyone at all interested in understanding the music they hear all around them. In addition to learning so much more about why music is structured the way it is, taking any class with Giancarlo is such a fantastic experience that I would recommend to anyone.", "[0.75] [Spring 2017] Do the homework well and you should do great!", "[1.0] [Spring 2017] I definitely recommend this course for anyone interested in making music or just gaining a better understanding and appreciation of music. You learn a lot about diatonic and chromatic harmony and solidify your voice leading skills. Also you get to compose a minuet which was probably my favorite assignment of the year because you get a lot of creative freedom and it's just fun making music and hearing it performed. My only criticisms are that lectures feel a little long at an hour 20 minutes (especially because we had it at 8:30am) and the quizzes/exams were sometimes a little disorganized with mistakes or not enough time to finish them.", "[0.9] [Winter 2017] It's a great class to take if you want to deepen your music theory knowledge; not only do we work with more colorful tones, we also get a little composition practice. It's also a relatively relaxed class and is made more enjoyable with Professor Aquilante's humor.", "[0.6] [Winter 2017] nice work. giancarlo is ok", "[0.4] [Winter 2017] This is when Elements of Music gets interesting.", "[0.85] [Winter 2017] This course is very well taught and a great way to continue learning about music theory since it introduces chromaticism and modulation. Giancarlo is an engaging and knowledgeable professor. Also, the work load is very manageable.", "[0.55] [Winter 2017] Music theory is important for any musician to learn, not just composers, because it helps make sense of music being listened to and music being performed.", "[0.7] [Winter 2017] Definitely take this.  Will improve musicianship and even composition skills by leaps and bounds.", "[0.95] [Winter 2017] Giancarlo is great and cares more that you learn the material than that you perform perfectly on assignments. This is a great course if you're hoping to dive deeper into music theory.", "[0.95] [Winter 2017] Definitely take it. Giancarlo is a great lecturer and this is the course where one learns how to move beyond simple diatonic harmonies into the start of some really interesting chromaticism. Good content, engaging lectures, reasonable workload.", "[0.95] [Winter 2017] This is one of the best classes I've taken at Stanford! Professor Aquilanti is so knowledgeable in the material, and he is so much fun! I really like how he teaches without any textbook and just teach following the logic of the music! I am so impressed how well he can quickly assembled \"some melody\" from some simple bassline. In addition, what he teaches beyond the scope of the course material is also very interesting, such as a little analysis on the classic pieces. Also, the workload is very manageable, and the homework is never redundant practices, I like how we got to compose some simple pieces on our own"], "MUSIC 220A": ["[0.75] [Autumn 2022] This class is fun and not that much work. You need to be interested in music technology and production, and have a solid programming background. If you don't have experience looking through api documentation and learning a new programming language by trial/error, you will have a hard time with assignments.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2022] Very fun class and you learn a lot. CCRMA is also a very cool place to have classes.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2022] Go for it if you enjoy computer music! It may not be about what you think though (at least not for me)! It was a refreshing experience and gave me knowledge on a new intersection between coding and music.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2022] Strong background in computer science and coding will be very helpful", "[0.8] [Autumn 2022] A great class for people interested in chuck", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] There is strong potential here to have a really meaningful course, but the potential, I find, is hindered by the scattered syllabus. What you are asked to do for hw assignments is only tangentially related to what is discussed in class. Class time is not dedicated to teaching you the technical abilities you will need for the assignments (coding ChucK, Javascript, and/or HTML), but rather discussing ideas associated with assignments. While classes were interesting, they did not contribute to my achieving the main thing I wanted to (i.e., developing proficiency in ChucK). While the teaching team and lecturers are amazing, kind, brilliant, and fun people who I quite enjoyed talking to, I really would not recommend this class to anyone. \nIf the syllabus was punched up and class and assignments focused on teaching ChucK from the ground up, it could be great. But it's just not there.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] Very much a you get out what you put into it course. If you want to make a cool final project, you need to use many resources outside what is taught in class and get help from the TAs and Chris in office hours. I wish the class time focused more on how to use Chuck and how to use it to create computer generated music, but I understand that this course is meant to be taken by not just those with CS experience. Sometimes in class I was really confused about what we were doing. Like some days we built microphones by hand and using soldering irons and other days we spent a ton of time listening to the CCRMA masters students in the class play their lo-fi beats on SoundCloud. I wish on these days they taught us more about Chuck because it is so cool.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2022] This is an interesting, if not the most organized, course. In their defense, they had to accommodate students with a crazy variety in backgrounds. There is a low bar but high ceiling. You are given a lot of interesting materials and assignments where you can easily whip up something to get a passing grade, but you can really dig into to your heart's content. I stopped going to class halfway through because the sessions would rarely be more than some joint work time and I could do that more productively on my own.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2022] n/a", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] This class is a really cool intro to coding music. It's super low-stress with cool field trips and awesome teaching staff.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] This is a really interesting class! I recommend taking it regardless of what music background you have because the course offers a rich selection of how computer music or unconventional music are produced. I have never encountered computer music in my life, so there's a big learning curve as many students here are grad students from CRRMA and they already have experience creating computer music. I highly suggest office hours because the TAs and Chris are so helpful. The lectures, however, are tough on students who are computer music novices, and they don't explain concepts too well, so there's a lot of self-learning. On the other hand, this course is very flexible and allows you to explore what you are interested in.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2021] This course is helpful in that it provides a good introduction to a wide range of topics covered in the CCRMA community.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2021] Highly recommend\u00b1", "[0.45] [Autumn 2021] Good survey course for computer music.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2021] This is a very introductory course musically and programming-wise, but you must advocate for yourself and learn a lot of coding aspects on your own. The coding aspects are rarely ever mentioned in class.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Note: this course is NOT about making music using Ableton, Logic, etc. It's about learning to use code to manipulate audio in different ways, which in my opinion was super cool. Definitely recommend if you're at all interested in this kind of stuff!", "[0.6] [Autumn 2021] I think this course is probably pretty challenging to take if you don't have previous programming experience.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2021] programming background is a big plus", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] This is a very interesting class and you will learn a lot. If you don't having any prior coding experience, like me, there will be a very steep learning curve. It's good though.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] Honestly, the range of students in this class is too big - as an MA student with software development experience, my coding knowledge is completely different from a freshman undergrad. This course often attempted to compromise in ways that ended up not working for either end of the range. While it was a good opportunity to learn and practice the specifics of Chuck and WebAudio API, I felt the assignments were often limiting and lecture material was a lot of review for me. Talking to some of the undergrads in this class, they felt the complete opposite, often confused and feeling like they were missing something. I think this course should have a minimal coding experience requirement and/or not be required for MAMST.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Super fascinating course that touches on the intersection of a ton of different subjects, with a bunch of people who are really truly passionate about music. It was a little intimidating coming in as someone with no music background, but truly no music background is required to do well in this class, just so long as you're interested! I feel like I learned as much from listening to the people around me as from the class itself.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] I don't really get this course. The overall energy of the classroom was strange--it was almost as if the grad students were trying to compete and show off to the undergrads. The undergrads in the class definitely were present in a class where I would've much preferred there to be more focus on instruction by Chris. Chris is absolutely fantastic, and the TAs were a great help, but most of the time this class had me thinking \"what is going on...?\" Easy class to fulfill MST requirement if necessary.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2021] This course felt like it was catered toward Graduate students, in that you don't really learn anything in class. It's all pretty much self-taught, and lectures are quite boring. The assignments are also not very well presented, so a lot of the time you feel like you have no idea what you are doing. This is definitely not an \"intro to computer music\" class although the assignments are all cool. Would only take this class if you need to.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] love how we get to hear from global speakers, love how relevant it is to music culture and industry at large, love the ability to learn from my peers", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Had a blast.

You'll have to spend some time experimenting and figuring things out yourself. Additionally, a lot of people in the class had prior experience with coding/music production (and I did not), which made me feel like I had to step up my game with creative HW/final projects, but that really should not be necessary. This is just a beginner's class.", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] Super fun! Definitely take it no matter what major you have. This will expand your mind in so many directions and you will be shocked at the music you will be able to create with the tools you learn.", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] This is a fun course to develop your computer music skills. The course is somewhat open-ended, and I learned the most from doing the assignments. The teaching staff are experienced and capable. Sharing our assignments in a small group throughout the quarter was rewarding.", "[0.3] [Spring 2021] Don't take this class TAs are cool, teachers not so much. Absolutely dont take it", "[0.85] [Spring 2021] It is a fun class with a good teaching team. I recommend it.", "[0.7] [Spring 2021] It's a lot of work, but rewarding.", "[-0.25] [Spring 2021] It was so so fun remotely, but I would take it in person if you can!! There's so much I missed out on", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] If you're interested at ALL in computer music or ANYTHING happening at CCRMA on the Knoll, Music 220A is the best \"Intro to CCRMA\" class and you stand to benefit tremendously by taking it as early into your Stanford career as possible. Don't be like me, only able to take it as one of my last CCRMA classes, enrolled 6 years after I started at Stanford lmao", "[0.0] [Autumn 2019] Take it to learn about audio basics and make stuff in your browser.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2019] professor choi is not the best teacher, but i appreciate how he asked for feedback and made changes in the midst of the quarter. the material is challenging but you'll definitely learn a lot.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2019] Great class! Take it!", "[-0.1] [Autumn 2019] If you have never done any music production then most of the concepts will be very foreign to you and quit hard to keep up with", "[0.0] [Autumn 2019] A lot of self learning required. Lectures don't really relate to the homework", "[1.0] [Autumn 2019] Cool concepts, but not necessarily tailored to undergrads. I took this for four units during a 20 unit quarter, and although I felt like I learned a lot and I think I did fine grade-wise, compared to the masters' students in the course I felt like I was always doing the bare minimum on the projects, and that I didn't really have time to make them as high quality as I would have liked. I also didn't have prior Javascript experience, though, so maybe somebody with more CS knowledge would have an easier time getting everything they want to out of the class. Hongchan is a fine instructor, and his code examples were extremely useful in understanding the course. So I would recommend the course, if you have the time to give it the attention it deserves.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] This is a fun course that will expose you to some really awesome functionality of web audio, taught by a wonderful lecturer in Hongchan. Be prepared to be challenged both creatively and technically.", "[-0.45] [Autumn 2019] Don't take this class if you aren't very experienced in JavaScript in its current form. The new implementation is unwelcoming and frustrating.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] You'll probably have a hard time in this class if you have no prior coding experience. Also, don't expect to have a deep understanding of concepts presented in class unless you do some research outside of lecture and outside of homeworks.  Overall, the class is very fun and interesting and CCRMA is a cool place to be. The class teaching team are very clearly passionate about what they're teaching.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] Excellent course! The web audio API is amazing!", "[0.0] [Autumn 2018] If you're a complete beginner to the topics, don't expect to learn from the ground up because the class is the same for undergrads and grads. You have to put some time into figuring out ChucK and all the audio processing stuff.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] If you are interested in thinking about music in a different way, or are at all interested in signal processing and synthesis, this is an excellent course.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] It is good enough as it is now. Chris is a wonderful teacher :)", "[0.7] [Autumn 2018] The expectations for this course are reasonable and flexible.  Further, Chris is an exceptional professor - this is a course that is absolutely worth taking if you are interested in learning more about computer music.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2018] Excellent instruction and fun projects.  You can work towards a final project bit by bit for every homework.", "[0.15] [Autumn 2018] take if you care about learning about sound generation! a lot of the work is only moderately correlated to what we do in class. interesting, but not if you don't like the field over all", "[0.45] [Autumn 2018] Good intro to the field.  You learn a lot from the projects, especially the whale recording field trip.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2018] Chris is great! Please take it", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] Not the most rigorous course, but nonetheless a chill, fun class that serves as a good introduction to CCRMA.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2018] Please take I love the structure of the class", "[0.0] [Autumn 2018] n/a", "[0.6] [Autumn 2018] Honestly I wish this class was more organized and the lecture material had more to do with the homework. The concepts themselves were very interesting, but it just didn't seem to all click together in the end, and was a little too open-ended (probably because there are a lot of very self directed grad students in the class)", "[-0.65] [Autumn 2018] It's a super cool class, but you have to teach a lot of it to yourself.  Classes aren't super helpful, but working through the assignments will teach you a lot about how to make computer generated music", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] Please take this course! Professor Chafe is extremely sweet and humorous! He provides a pain-free introduction to ChucK. He encourages you to utilize the concepts explored in class to create musical projects that interest you and apply to your unique musical journey.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2018] Great course!!! Take it!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] You get out what you put in on this one and you can slide by without too much effort.

This is a pretty solid computer-music intro course.", "[0.5] [Autumn 2018] Pretty lowkey class. Projects are fun but you learn what you put into it.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2017] This course is a great tool to develop ideas for future projects and it is a great start in implementing those.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2017] Make use of the resources provided on the class website, and you gain more by doing the readings.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2017] Definitely worth a take. The course load all depends on you, if you do more, you learn more, but overall it won't take you much time, while you can learn a lot of cool stuff.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2017] Start projects early. They sound straightforward, but ChucK doesn't always cooperate.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2017] This was an amazing class! Students got a great introduction to all aspects of computer-generated sound. It is low in difficulty but we learned so much. Students leave this class inspired to continue learning audio technology. We even went on two field trips! This is one of the best courses at Stanford.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2017] It is helpful to have some programming experience (minimal is fine), as there is not much instruction on that. However, the class is open-ended with regard to assignments, which allows you to take it in a direction you want.", "[0.5] [Autumn 2017] You get out what you put in - do the readings and engage with the TAs! (Also go on the class trips!!)", "[0.6] [Autumn 2017] Make sure you know how to operate Chuck (or know someone who could help) before taking this class", "[0.35] [Autumn 2017] lectures don't necessarily relate to the hw. No demonstration of chucK in class for the most part. Would like it.", "[-0.1] [Autumn 2017] meh.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] A fun class, but have a realistic idea of what you want out of it. The course description is pretty accurate to what you learn. Be aware that while the instructors are always extremely helpful and knowledgeable, what goes on in class doesn't follow the assignments too closely", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] super fun and creative course while also incorporating technical pieces! highly recommend", "[0.95] [Autumn 2017] There are a lot of really cool things about this class. You learn how to make underwater microphones and regular air microphones. You get to go on an awesome trip to record whale sounds in Monterrey Bay with the mic you made and another trip to the SF MOMA to see cool sound art installations and anything else you want. The main focus of this class however is the music programming language ChucK. The language is really interesting and gives you a lot of freedom to make sounds and music that would be impossible without coding. I was blown away by the variety and quality of the final projects in this class. However, the class does not teach you how to use the language to the level you need to do well in the class. The only other coding class I've taken was CS 106A a few years ago and I found myself really struggling to complete most of the assignments because I just didn't know how to use the language and they were not teaching us how to use it in class. If you have a coding background it will probably be no problem for you, but if you don't have a lot of coding experience it can be very difficult. Luckily there is an online course on Kadenze that teaches ChucK, which I found to be tremendously helpful. I still recommend this class but be prepared to teach yourself how to use a new language mostly on your own.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2017] Take it! Go whale watching! MiniAudicle is kind of a mess; run it in the terminal. ChucK is ok once you learn it. Put a lot into this class and you will get a lot out of it. Associate with the CCRMA people. They do so many cool things. If you need help with anything the TA's are amazing.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2016] A good deal of learned information comes from readings and isn't explicitly discussed in class.", "[-0.15] [Autumn 2016] Class attendance doesn't seem too important...", "[0.95] [Autumn 2016] Be brave with the homework assignments. While they are open ended (as mandated by the creative aspect of them), do more than the minimum effort to gain the most out of the excercises. The tools used are complex and powerful, and can help you in future work greatly if you take the time to familiarize.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2016] Go to office hours!, there is so many more knowledge there", "[0.75] [Autumn 2016] Definitely take this as it illustrates a really cool area of research and topic that is just interesting. It is difficult but doable if you ask for help", "[0.0] [Autumn 2016] Take it!", "[0.75] [Autumn 2016] This is a.compulsory course for MA/MSTs. It's pretty relaxed and you get introduced to a lot new genres.of music", "[0.2] [Autumn 2016] Not much pressure", "[-0.6] [Autumn 2016] I really don't like the course arrangement in this quarter. The experiment clearly failed this year. There are a lot of guest lectures, always taking a half of the class. The real teaching parts are not that useful for assignments, and Chris is not really a good instructor. He is not totally comfortable with the thing he's teaching, and he doesn't know how he can convey the knowledge most efficiently to students. Maybe the older version of this is better, where people do learn how to program in Chuck, and do get practice, and do know this language and what to do with the language in the end of the quarter.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2016] the grad students know their stuff, but don't get intimidated by them. a very 'teach yourself' kind of class, pretty chill but can also be easily neglected and hard to follow along. but i still recommend it as a class to fulfill a CS elective", "[-0.3] [Autumn 2016] Would not recommend this course. It was poorly organized, and little to no instruction was given on how to complete the assignments. \"Lectures\" were usually an hour of music sharing, which was interesting at times but seldom helpful, followed by a presentation from a guest artist and about 10 minutes of actual lecture. Actual lecture was not only too short to learn anything, but also largely irrelevant to the homework. Only take this class if you have to (for the MST minor/major/masters).", "[0.9] [Autumn 2016] It is actually quite a bit of work, but nothing to stress over. Definitely worth putting in the time to understand things, because that let's you make really cool projects.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2016] Its fun and you learn new interesting things", "[0.85] [Autumn 2016] This is a fun class if you know before hand that you like the subject material a lot. If you don't know and are trying to figure it out, this class might get a little dry.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2016] This class is definitely as much time as you put into it. You'd probably get the most out of the class by attending lectures in person and getting to know the teaching staff and other staff at CCRMA on a personal basis, as the homework assignments are not too well-documented and you often have to ask other people for help. Also, the assignments aren't super relevant to lecture and vice versa. It's a good space to explore the different resources that CCRMA has to offer and to see if you are interested in computational music. For me, I realized that the whole time I was looking for a different experience, as I am more interested in making electronic music and auditory storytelling which is very different from the content of the class. Still, cool stuff and you'd enjoy it if you put enough time.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2016] Yeah, take it! Great community", "[0.45] [Autumn 2016] Good intro to the technology that goes behind music.", "[-0.95] [Autumn 2016] I wouldn't recommend it.  I think it could be good if it were reformed. But it was so disorganized.  The classes didn't have anything to do with the assignments, so it ended up being kind of a waste to go to class.  The assignments were so weird; I feel like I just had to teach myself chuck and spend hours just figuring out what was going on.  And then there were links on the assignments that didn't work or directions that didn't make sense.  It's not that the course was hard; just was a real pain (and I also really don't like the ChucK language at all).", "[0.7] [Autumn 2016] This is a great course to be introduced to various aspects of computer music.  To its benefit more open-ended than most Stanford courses and there are many directions you can take the assignments.  The ramp up learning to deal with the technical problems of audio hardware is a little steep and can be frustrating.  Expert programming skills aren't required but are very helpful of course.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2016] Ask for help the minute you need it, and have fun!"], "MUSIC 220B": ["[0.95] [Winter 2022] Music 220B is the highlight of my winter quarter! I learned so much about different mediums of music composition and expression. It was initially very challenging, but Ge is so supportive, which gave me the confidence to thrive in this class. You get what you put in. I felt a lot happier when I spent more time thinking about my composition and projects. Please take this in a lighter quarter where you will have time to ponder upon developing your unique musical expressions!", "[-0.1] [Winter 2022] You will learn a lot, but it will take a lot of your time, so plan your Quarter to leave the appropriate amount of time (around 20 h per week) to work on the projects.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] This course is really great! It's a step up from 220A in terms of the amount of ChucK code you're writing, which meant that my skills also improved a lot! Ge and Kunwoo are a great teaching team, and always willing to help teach you how to do things you want to accomplish in ChucK.", "[0.8] [Winter 2022] Ge's instruction and assignments challenged me to develop my artist voice in a way I wasn't able to do in 220A. That's the heart of what I got out of the class, having made a couple of piece I am proud of, in addition to getting more hands-on experience wrestling ChucK.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] Definitely a heavier courseload. Loads of fun, but make sure you have enough time to devote to it!", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] I would tell a future student to try and find out early which of the homeworks resonate the most with you and make a conscious effort to put in more work for those assignments than the ones that don't. I did that for this quarter I felt that it was necessary  both manage the workload of this class with everything else going on and because I think it was more worthwhile for me to come out of the homeworks with one or two pieces that I'm happy with (and will try to use in some way in the future) plus several so-so pieces than 5 decent pieces that I don't really feel strongly about. I don't think this needs to be framed negatively either, maybe just think of it as picking n homeworks where the goal is to apply a lot of compositional craft and refinement and m homeworks where you say to yourself \"I'm going to explicitly try this new, specific idea and whatever happens, happens and don't try to get lost in the details\"\n\nTo that end, being able to find that information early in the quarter is extremely helpful and I hope it continues to be shown early to the students.", "[0.5] [Winter 2022] Don't be afraid to take the assignments in the direction you want - they are guidelines, not a checklist. You will get a lot more out of the course if you use it as a creative space to try things out rather than just doing the homework to do it.", "[0.75] [Winter 2022] Really good class, and the instructors are very helpful and understanding", "[0.35] [Winter 2022] This is an enjoyable, flexible course. You can really make it your own with in the boundaries of the assignments. The lectures don't need to be as long as they are, but the amount of homework is just right.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] If you don't have previous experience with ChucK, definitely spend the first few weeks trying as much as possible to gain proficiency so you have more freedom to explore new techniques later in the course instead of catching up.", "[0.9] [Winter 2021] A super cool course. It's more of an artistic community than a lecture-based course, since around half of our lectures were spent listening to and critiquing each others' projects and milestones. That was an ideal setup for the course though, since I learned the most from this class by struggling through my projects, hearing feedback, and watching other peoples' work. The projects can be a ton of work, so make sure to start them early. This is definitely one of those courses where you get out what you put in.", "[0.35] [Winter 2021] If, like me, you have interests spanning both music and computer science, I couldn't imagine a better course to take!", "[0.9] [Winter 2021] This is the most fun class I've taken so far at Stanford. The teachers are amazing and the assignments are really fun. If you know anything about music and/or programming, I urge you to take it!", "[0.75] [Winter 2021] Excellent class that will open your mind. Ge is a fantastic lecturer--if not this, be sure to take another course with him.", "[0.85] [Winter 2021] It is an amazing course with an even more amazing lecturer!", "[0.1] [Winter 2021] Take it if you want to work on your skills in Algorithmic Composition with an open-minded professor", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] Ge's classes are some of the best I've taken here, and 220b is no exception. Workload wise, 220b is not as heavy as 256a.You get to play with ChucK and learn more sound synthesis tools/concepts to be creative with. You can tell the teaching team cares about you as a person first. They were very reasonable and accommodating towards our class in these remote learning circumstances. The class community was also very supportive and is quick to offer support and resources. A wonderful course!", "[0.25] [Winter 2021] Can feel a bit overwhelming, especially over Zoom. It's a course where you get out what you put in, so I would recommend taking a lighter courseload along with the class. Really pay attention to the milestones; I had a mentality to \"get work done\" so I could get to my other classes, which made things harder for me when trying to take in all the feedback from milestones.", "[0.25] [Winter 2019] Come with an open mind and prepare to be surprised.", "[0.0] [Winter 2019] Fun and low pressure environment to explore a new form of composition based on Chuck and computer music techniques.", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] Ge is passionate about the course content, and his enthusiasm is contagious. It shows because some of the projects made by students in this class are incredibly cool!", "[0.5] [Winter 2019] If you want to learn about computer music by actually doing it, I highly recommend this class.", "[0.55] [Winter 2019] Have fun with it! You'll get more out of it if you study chucK outside of class", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] Take it! Ge is sooooo cool. He will totally bend your mind. He offers a unique approach to design and inspires you to be your most creative self. He makes you want to try your best and give it your all in projects. Ge is my role model!!! He is so unapologetically himself and displays an authentic and complete love for his field. Gosh, he's such an awesome human being! :D Ok, I could compliment Ge for days, but seriously, take the course!", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] Hands down one of the favorite classes I've taken at Stanford. If you've taken Music 220a and liked it/want to continue making music in that way I would 100% recommend it. Ge is a fantastic teacher. You definitely get from it what you put in though, so be prepared to really put effort and thought into your assignments.", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] Would be better, though not strictly necessary, to have some computer music knowledge coming in. This class is pretty open-ended (which is both good and bad) and will be what you make out of it. There's a lot of opportunity to experiment with new design / sound techniques.", "[0.5] [Winter 2019] don't expect to take away understanding every technicality of ChucK and creating music with a computer. expect to for the way you think as an artistic individual to be pushed and allow it to push you to the extreme. this class i much more than merely making a computer go \"beep.\" much much more.", "[0.7] [Winter 2019] This course is a low-stress way to explore audio synthesis and ideas for personal music composition. Don't expect much in the way of professor instruction or feedback on specific techniques. This is not about developing a diverse palette of ways to make sound creatively, but instead about doing a deep dive into two or three pretty ancient / solidified ways of programming sound.", "[0.45] [Winter 2018] Planning on the final project in advance might be useful.", "[0.5] [Winter 2018] Do it. Just don't expect CS-heavy lectures; there's definitely coding in there, but there's also philosophy, aesthetics, and pictures of food. Roll with it, it'll be worth it.", "[0.9] [Winter 2018] Ge is incredibly passionate and knowledgeable about the subject and cares about his students\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhe makes the class worth taking. Definitely have some programming experience (not necessarily 220A) coming in, so you can pick up ChucK quickly,", "[0.1] [Winter 2018] Is an okay class but is a little too open ended.", "[0.65] [Winter 2018] definitely take if you are remotely interested in computer music", "[1.0] [Winter 2018] I highly recommend this course if you want to make dope music with computers. Ge has very high expectations and does not tolerate bullshit or low-effort work. So don't take this class if you are not willing to put thought and effort into it. What this means is that you get a group of students who are all motivated and putting out great work and pushing each other to be better. Don't let that frighten you though, this class is a joy when you discover your own power to make dope stuff and express yourself creatively and you hear great things your classmates are making. There are like 4 major assignments throughout the quarter each focused on a compositional technique (comb filters, generative music, granular synthesis, etc.). Probably around 50% of the classes end up being presenting a draft of your work or the final versions. The rest of classes are either learning how to use the compositional techniques, talking about philosophy of computer music and art, or if you're lucky watching Koyaanisqatsi (which you should watch even if you don't take this class). Overall this has been one of my favorite classes I've taken- it has been one the few classes I've taken that have allowed me to express myself creatively and has helped me discover an artistic voice that I didn't know I had.", "[0.75] [Winter 2017] Definitely take it, it has interesting lectures and cool homework assignments.", "[0.75] [Winter 2017] I'd recommend putting a decent amount of time into each of the assignments, since they give you a lot of freedom to explore topics and sounds.", "[1.0] [Winter 2017] I really enjoyed taking this course because the instructors, Kitty and Tim, were really nice and super knowledgable. It also takes place in CCRMA which is a fun space to be in. It was also awesome, coming from 600  student CS classes, to have the chance to take a class with less than 10 students. If you are a CS major, take this class if you are looking for a chill, fun, course that also fulfills HCI track requirements, and/or if you are interested in learning about practical computational music techniques or just checking out the CCRMA community.", "[0.9] [Winter 2017] Continues to expand on using ChucK to explore computer music.  I had a great time with this class and really its one where you get out what you put in.

Attendance / participation in-person feels really important, though - sometimes it was a challenge to see / hear remotely but the content was all really cool and worth following.  And in-person could have enabled more collaboration.  But everyone was super-helpful.", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] This is great class to take if you have an interesting project in mind! The professors are really open to all sorts of research projects, and the small class size means you get good feedback from the other students / professors each week. There aren't any required readings, which makes the class fairly relaxed.", "[0.8] [Spring 2020] Great time to hone one of your creative tech projects.", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] Take this course if you are looking for time and space to work on a cool individual project (in any stage). Jonathan is a very supportive advisor and instructor for this class who will make the time and space to support you in the ways you need it, and always has great advice to give about your work (on both the micro and macro scale).", "[0.6] [Spring 2020] This class is amazing if you have a personal project in mind. Jonathan is there with you every step of the way and every piece of feedback is constructive. Think big at first and hone it down over the course of the quarter.", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] This is an amazing course! Jonathan and Camille made a great teaching team, encouraging us throughout the process in a way that gave us space to work on our projects without busywork that interfered with other classes. This led to some really cool final projects by the end of the course, so I would definitely recommend!", "[0.9] [Spring 2019] Fun class. You will get exactly what you put into it. It's easy to slack off in this class but please don't waste your qtr.

It is a good environment to get feedback on your project.", "[0.9] [Spring 2017] You will get a lot out of this course if you have a good idea for a project either going into the course or after the first week of thinking about it. The project should be something you're excited to work on and you could benefit from hearing feedback on. Then, you'll benefit immensely from taking the class!", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] A great way to finish off the 220 series.

Erik is a friendly, knowledgeable instructor with great taste in selecting which pieces from the literature to study. Homework ranges from worksheets and compositions to analysis. In-class midterms were not too hard but the take-home final is more thought-provoking.  The seminar style of this class (all crowded around one table), compared to the lecture hall style in 22, made me feel much closer to the instructors and classmates.

In 23 you finally begin to be able to break many of the rules you learned in 21 and 22 and it really feels like you have a lot more freedom in creating music and the music you analyze gets much more interesting. This is a pretty low-pressure class; assignments are not that time-consuming and if you come to class and do the assignments you will probably do fine. The main assignment- the art song- involves setting a poem to music for voice and piano. It has been one of my favorite assignments form my time at Stanford because it allows for a lot of creative expression and it is a joy to see your piece being performed by talented musicians.", "[0.9] [Spring 2017] The music theory that we learn in this class is different and certainly more challenging than anything we've learned about earlier in the music theory series. Despite that, Talya is a very sweet and understanding teacher who is there to help and answer questions; she also gives us ample practice with analyzing music so we can identify the concepts we learn about in class and how they're implemented in the music.I learned more in depth about how to build the Neopolitan chord and augmented sixth chords (Italian, German, French) and how to use these chords when writing my own harmonies. I also learned about special embellishing chords (such as the CT dim 7) and modulations to more distant keys.", "[0.9] [Spring 2017] Talya is a really kind instructor who is always very enthusiastic. The class is overall enjoyable!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2016] Talya is a really caring and funny person, but her time management skills as an instructor are not the best. That said, she puts a lot of effort into compiling a good course reader and making up exercises to practice the material. Pay attention to how she does voice leading! It's the most valuable thing you can get out of lectures and will actually help you when composing. The final project is an art song, which is challenging but also really fun.

Paul is a fount of knowledge, with experience in a variety of areas (theory, composition, musicology, in addition to conducting). Given the array of prominent conductors he's trained under, studying with him and hearing his stories feels like being a part of the ongoing tradition of Western art music. Since there's so much to talk about, you'll have to be a little disciplined about staying focused, since interesting tangents can lead to all sorts of places (and potentially cut into your conducting time!). But hey, you have to decide what you want to get out of your lessons with him!\n\nPaul is a person with convictions, and you can count on him to give an honest opinion about anything. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Paul can also be a sensitive mentor. When I came to one lesson, having practiced but seriously lacking confidence, Paul took a slightly different approach than usual, and he helped me to build confidence and joy in what I was preparing.

Often times we spent large swaths of class--30 minutes, and even 40 minutes at the longest--undirected. Most everyone in the class just sat on their phones during that time. It would be helpful if Professor DeMarinis communicated how we can help him or do work during that time. In general, Professor DeMarinis  seems extremely knowledgeable about the subject matter, but was not so effective at conveying it to the students. It seemed a lot of times that there was some assumed level of knowledge, jargon, historical context, etc. that wasn't there.", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] The profesor is amazing!

I have been playing music for over 10 years, but I haven't really worked as much on the theory. Although I definitely regret this, at least there are classes like these that allows you to improve your understanding of music theory (from a listening and singing standpoint) and teach you everything you need to know step by step. It takes work to improve your singing and hearing, but if you do it methodically every day (for like 10 or 20 minutes), you should be very successful.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2022] Very good intro to ear training!

Ear training really helps you critically listen and understand all music that you hear.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] I consider myself to be a pretty talented musician, but when it comes to these aural skills, I have always been less confident. Erika's method of teaching may seem basic at first, as I thought, but it serves to build really good fundamentals, and consequently, you can do much more with higher levels of accuracy.

You will not be able to cram.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] As someone who got into music because I thought the theory was cool and had never really created/performed music before, this class hit me like a freight train. But, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. I learned a ton, and Erika is very supportive.

Most of the benefits of the class come with consistent practice.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] This is an extremely interesting and useful course and Erika is an incredible instructor. If you are struggling, reach out! Be prepared to put in the practice outside of lecture to see results and do well on the exams (which are not graded lightly), but again, there is always help if you need it. Keyboard harmony and harmonic progression content was definitely taught a bit faster than I would have preferred, but that was likely a result of the odd schedule of Covid and online instruction. Practice!", "[0.5] [Winter 2022] Erika is such a good teacher. Take a class with her whether you are majoring/minoring in music or just want to have trained ears.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] This class is not a two-unit class worth of work. Be prepared to work carefully. You have to really be thinking, and practicing more often is better than cramming, so make sure you find a way to fit time into your schedule a couple of times a week.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] This is a really good and very challenging course. You will learn a lot but you need to put in the practice time outside of class to really internalize the skills and information. I\u2019m glad I took it. I learned so much!", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] This class is incredible difficult for people with no musical background, or below advanced level. This class was harder for me than my chem and physics classes put together. But it's rewarding :)", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] If you find ear training hard you will be in good company. This class is hard and the commitment is far more than 2 units.

Really well taught even online.", "[0.25] [Spring 2021] This course is well taught and straightforward.", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] This class is very fun! Both the professor and TA were very nice and flexible with learning material to make sure we understood everything.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] 24a isn't as bad as a lot of the previous reviews say it is. Expect around 2-3 hours a week of homework plus 2 hours of required lecture. Erika and Lorenzo (TA) were really cool. The singing homework is graded very strictly. Also, I highly recommend having at least Music 21 finished (or co-enrolled in), or a decent theory background. A lot of students without the theory background had a hard time understanding things in the last 2-3 weeks of class. Lastly, if you come from a strong piano background, you will have a big advantage, as your ear will be better at recognizing chords (major, minor, dim, aug, sevenths), their inversions, and intervals.", "[0.85] [Winter 2021] Erika is amazing!! Don't be afraid to ask questions, she answers helpfully and without judgement.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] It's a worthwhile class, but definitely more work than you would expect from 2 units, and the grading scale is fairly harsh. That being said, Erika is excellent at teaching and will help you succeed in the class if you put in the effort.", "[0.5] [Autumn 2020] It really helped me understand the complexities behind tonal music and improved the basic capacity of my ear to hear/identify specific musical elements.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] This course has a fantastic instructor that is willing to thoroughly address any misconceptions you may have. You may seem skeptical about having virtual ear training, but Erika did a great job adapting and giving us as many resources as she could to fulfill our experience.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2020] Take it! More work than a typical 2-unit class, but lots of fun.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] This course takes a lot of extra effort for only being 1-2 units, but it is definitely very rewarding.", "[0.4] [Autumn 2019] Definitely take it! It was a challenge, but opened my eyes (and ears!) up to a whole new world of music.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] - This is definitely a very heavy 2 unit course.  - Requires consistent practise if you want to do well. - You learn a great deal", "[0.75] [Autumn 2019] Practice by sight-singing and playing things on the piano. Beautiful crossover with Music 21! Erika is lovely and really cares, but you gotta practice otherwise whoops.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2019] It's more work than a 2 unit class, and developing the skills is challenging and sometimes very frustrating. The assignments tend to take a substantial amount of time outside of class. That said, Erika is helpful and funny, and you really bond with the other students in the class.", "[0.4] [Autumn 2019] take it but don't take it if you don't have the time to commit every day", "[0.7] [Winter 2019] If you are not interested in classical music, I would strongly advise against taking this course. Erika is a wonderful person and instructor; make sure you have time in your schedule to make the most out of this class.", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] Erika is such a cool person and great lecturer. If you have a strong musical background, this class might be a bit slow, but you can definitely still get a lot--how much you get from it is also heavily dependent on how much you put in. You can take this class without taking Music 22 or another theory class, you just need to email her in advance to ask. Overall, a great class that helps you improve your ear training a lot.", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] Definitely worth more than 1 unit, but a very nice class to improve your ears. Erika is very invested in each one of her students", "[0.7] [Winter 2019] This class, while interesting, is also difficult. Erika is a good teacher although sometimes some of her comments about the students felt like public roasts.", "[0.25] [Winter 2019] I always found ear-training to be a fascinating and incredibly useful skill to have as a musician. This class does an excellent job of honing aural skills, but I will say that sometimes it requires constant work to avoid falling behind.", "[0.35] [Winter 2019] Good for developing basic skills that are important in range of ventures. Ignore the normative claims rooted in 19th century musical conventions (this is THE ONLY WAY music works/sounds good, etc.). Erika is a character but knows what she's doing, and the class is what you put into it.", "[0.85] [Winter 2019] Only take this course if you need to for the major/minor/certificate or youre very motivated to improve at ear training. Ear training seems mostly useful for pianists/composers, neither of which I don't identify as. It was very difficult for me to hear/notate melodies/chords, and felt like the course moved very quickly.", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] Erika's a great teacher, so take it if you're invested in improving your dictation and sight-singing skills.", "[0.55] [Winter 2019] This class is much more work than the 2 units suggests. You will have to spend lots and lots of time practicing on your own if you want to succeed.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2018] MUSIC24A was a very difficult course; however, my skills have TREMENDOUSLY improved through taking this class. There is a lot of work--including daily practice you SHOULD do--and it can be difficult, but the skills gained from this class are worth it. Erika is a demanding professor, but she asks much in order to get you from point A to point B. While she may be tough, she is a brilliant musician and a wonderful teacher. If you are ever struggling in the class and need words of wisdom, she is the best person to talk to. Best of luck to you--work smart, work hard, and you will see results.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2018] This class can take up all of your time if you have it available. It's on you to get any skills out of the class, it's not enough to just show up.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] This class is amazing! Erika is a wonderful instructor, and the genuine care she shows for her students is clear.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] This class is difficult and takes up way more time than a two unit class. However, I learned and improved so much in such a short amount of time. Erika is honestly one of the best and most helpful teachers I've ever had.", "[0.6] [Winter 2018] Highly recommended taking this in conjunction with Music 21 as they recommend in the department. However, this is not an absolute requirement.   If you've loved music for the longest time, but never understood why, this IS THE CLASS FOR YOU!", "[0.95] [Winter 2018] Take this course \u00e2\u20ac\u201d you will gain so much knowledge and experience in how to approach music in general, whether it be through instrumental or vocal means. However, it is essential to have a sense of how to sing and play the piano beforehand. I would suggest you have a snug musical foundation before tackling the course for your greatest benefit. Professor Arul is such an understanding and kind soul. She is very encouraging and humorous!", "[-0.5] [Winter 2018] it is difficult if you are acquiring these skills from scratch, and it requires a lot of time to actually see improvement. take during a quarter where you will have a lot of time to practice on your own. instruction is good but class can be scary at times (getting cold-called)", "[0.75] [Winter 2018] Erika is a great teacher. I learned a lot and it's kind of cool when you realize you can recognize the structure behind what you're listening to.", "[0.0] [Winter 2018] DO IT! and practice every day, whenever you can!", "[-0.3] [Winter 2018] This can be a very difficult class without prior ear training experience, but anyone who takes this class (regardless of level) and puts in the effort will get something out of it!", "[-0.55] [Winter 2018] Difficult for an intro class. Be warned", "[0.95] [Winter 2018] I have much less musical background than other students in the class. I struggled immensely, as I felt the class moved at the light speed whereas I can develop skills at the sound speed. But Erika and Julie (the TA) were extremely supportive and helpful in helping me learn. I made several appointments with Julie and she helped me a lot each time. 10 weeks were a short time. My sight singing still needs a lot more work even after this class, but I've got much better ideas now how to improve this skill (read: more practice).", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] Ear training is by far one of the most rewarding and satisfying pursuits I have encountered. I always look forward to this class, and if you have space at all and any remote interest in music. take it for sure.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2017] You have to make time to practice", "[0.75] [Autumn 2017] The class can be challenging, but ultimately very rewarding", "[0.2] [Autumn 2017] It's a hard class and way more work than the credits would suggest; you need to practice a lot. Not worth taking unless you want to pursue music", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] Erika is so good at finding the perfect balance between encouraging and challenging. This class is a lot of work, but is also really rewarding. Come humble and you'll learn a lot.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] This class will definitely take more than 2 units of your time. But if you do want to progress in music, then music listening is a skill that is pretty vital.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2017] Erika can be harsh and this is a heavy 2-unit class, but she is an excellent teacher and I learned so much", "[0.95] [Autumn 2017] This class is the single best course to take to become a better musician. You learn so much about how to listen to music and pick apart its structure, and Erika is a fantastic teacher. Would highly recommend.", "[-0.25] [Winter 2017] This course is a dark horse. Make sure you budget A LOT of time (10 hours a week) to practice and perform your skills. If you don't have much experience with sight singing and conducting at the same time this class will be more than just \"2 units.\" I heard from over 50% (4 people) that this class was the most difficult of their quarters. Plan to be worked! The teacher is brilliant and patient but there is no way around the assignments and performance quizzes.", "[0.25] [Winter 2017] This course is very challenging, despite the fact that it is only 2 units. Professor Arul may seem like she is being hard on you, but you will learn a lot.", "[-0.05] [Autumn 2016] I'd like to tell the student that you get great practice improving your ear and in ways that you might not have done before. The exercises and practice will be challenging, especially if the student does not possess perfect pitch, but they should know that other students will be struggling with the exercises too.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2016] Be prepared to work a lot outside of class if you have limited ear training experience.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2016] This course is fairly challenging and requires you to put in work in order to improve. The material is taught very well.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2016] This course can be REALLY REALLY REALLY hard if u don't have a very strong musical background or a good pair of ears, like me :) and can feel like a 4 or even 5 unit course. And although she's in fact really helpful, Erika can be a little mean sometime lol so watch out for that", "[0.6] [Autumn 2016] This class is VERY challenging if you do not have an extensive music theory background. Erika gets you there, though, if you are prepared to put in the effort!"], "MUSIC 24B": ["[0.55] [Autumn 2022] Beware of taking it with people with perfect pitch.", "[-0.45] [Winter 2022] If you don't have perfect pitch, it can take a lot of practice outside of class to complete the work and prepare for the quizzes (more than 2 units).", "[0.45] [Winter 2022] It really helps with how you perceive music.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Erika Arul is amazing. You learn so, so much, and your skills as a musician improve rapidly. She jam packs so much harmony in one quarter, and it is incredible to see your growth. Definitely, please take MUSIC 22 with or before this course. I didn't, so many of the concepts that we were training our ears to hear for (such as secondary dominants, diminished chords, cadences, etc.) were also concepts that I have never been introduced to before that, making the course incredibly difficult. With that said, the course for me served as a dual role as being also a crash course in music theory. It has definitely piqued my interest in music theory and served as a jumping off point for me to want to learn more! Also, the class is NOT two units of work. Without even counting the time spent towards practice, assignments, and studying for this class, You already spend 3 hours of lecture plus another hour of section each week for this class. I hope that Stanford increases the unit count for this class so that students get their well-deserved credit.", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] If you have just taken Music24A and are wondering whether to take 24B now or later, now is certainly the time. The course is challenging, but Erika and your TA are wealths of knowledge ready and equipped to help. That said, your grades are your grades--it can get bad, and it is up to you to put in the practice necessary to improve. Unless your ear trains exceptionally fast, you can expect this to call for a bit more time than a standard 2-unit. All that said, TAKE IT! These are extremely valuable skills.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] Music 24b is definitely a big step up from 24a. Everything is harder (longer homework, harder dictations, melodies, etc.). This class was also a lot of homework: sing 2-3 hard melodies (often with 5+ accidental key signatures and tenor/alto clef) perfectly, long vocal arpeggiations, and a 2 chorale dictations, melodies, and chord progressions, and then chord IDs. I'm really fast at this type of work and it still took me around 5 hours to finish each week. I think the singing is something that really was a huge pain- it had to be perfect (and I mean perfect) in order to get 50 out of 50 points. Overall, if you're a major you have to take this. If you're a minor, take it if you have bad aural skills. Just know that this class is not easy. Also, Erika is a great instructor. If you actually go to her Office Hours, you'll do a lot better.", "[0.65] [Spring 2021] Erika is great - take the course!", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] Erika is a great teacher, and she will help you understand the material. The class is significantly more work than you would normally expect from 2 units, so be prepared when you plan for it. Additionally, the content is highly geared toward Western classical music, particularly for instrumentalists, and requires a fairly strong background in music theory to progress without struggling a bit.", "[0.9] [Winter 2021] Plan to practice the materials everyday for success and understanding. The lecture / discussion time is pretty minimal, but you gain a lot from those class sessions to use in the weekly homework. It has especially helped me in ensemble playing and teaching younger musicians.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] This is a great course to take! You will learn substantially about how to listen to music differently and more effectively. It really changes your whole perspective on the harmonic functions in any piece. As long as you plan out your work accordingly, you will succeed in the class.", "[0.7] [Winter 2021] Take it\u2014Erika is super helpful especially if you're not the most solid with the material", "[0.8] [Winter 2021] Take your time and be okay with not knowing things. You can't really fake your way through ear training so just enjoy the process.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] Erika is awesome! I didn't take 24A because of some scheduling issues, but if you do the 1-8 sight reading chapters (on note names or fixed do ONLY-- I made the mistake of not knowing that) and practice recognizing triads/dom 7ths + inversions then you'll be pretty set (in addition to melodic dictations of course). She definitely helps you transition into this course and I was super worried at first but it is very manageable if you put the time in. There's a learning curve without 24A but you definitely get there quickly. Totally recommend if you're even only thinking about becoming a musician in the future.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] Definitely a learning curve if you didn't take 24A. Erika is wonderful and super nice and helpful. TAs may or may not be hard graders, especially if they have perfect pitch.", "[0.9] [Winter 2021] A really great class, Erika is amazing as always. This is definitely quite a bit harder than 24A, so it will require more practice and time (I regret not practicing consistently over time, as cramming did not work for the quizzes...) But it's a very fulfilling class, since you finally get to start learning about more complex chords and patterns, so would recommend to anyone who enjoyed 24A.", "[0.85] [Winter 2021] Try to become more comfortable with singing during class! I felt that when I started volunteering more that I became better at singing. Also, music theory in general started to feel more natural.", "[0.8] [Winter 2021] Take it! Erika is great and you really build off 24A in a nice way.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2020] Erika really only wants the best for her students. Every conversation with her is super helpful and productive. It's a little more work than just a \"smaller 2 unit class\" but nothing that is not doable!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] Taking this course is a great way to develop your aural and sight-singing skills. Erika is kind and helpful, and the assignments are incredibly fun!", "[0.3] [Autumn 2020] It's cool", "[0.4] [Spring 2020] I wouldn't recommend it online. Though the professor is there for you to help, you're gonna miss out on some crucial elements of the course and I wish I would have waited to take it.", "[-0.45] [Spring 2020] This is a great course and Erika is amazing, but ear training is just hard. Depending on your ear and experience, this course could be anywhere from the 1-2 units listed to 5 units. But you'll probably know what it's like for you before the add drop deadline and will be able to make an informed decision. The workload stays pretty consistent throughout.   If you have any trouble, email or call Erika! I almost dropped the course week 3 because I was rusty after more than a year off from 24A and struggling with the online format. But I called Erika for 45 minutes and she gave me a crash course review on all the stuff I couldn't remember and from then on the class was totally manageable.", "[0.0] [Spring 2020] You learn more concrete material that has a direct effect on your life than you would in any other class", "[0.7] [Spring 2020] Erika is amazing!!!", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] Fantastic. After 24A, you know what you're getting with Erika. She's incredibly knowledgeable and helpful, and she cares a lot about the success of her students. The material is very interesting too.", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] Erika is the best!! Plus the class is amazing. Take it!!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Erika is very caring and helpful. Your class will probably be small and therefore provide room for lots of personalized feedback. She will praise you for improvement and point out exact ways in which you can improve. Make sure to review class material and practice the aural skills outside of class frequently and you'll naturally improve. Light workload except for a ~3 hour project due every other week or so!", "[0.65] [Autumn 2019] Ear training can be challenging, but I have had a good experience with ear training at Stanford.", "[0.5] [Autumn 2019] Erika, I'd say, is the most helpful teacher I've ever had at Stanford.", "[0.85] [Spring 2019] Don&#x2019;t feel like you can&#x2019;t do ear training just because you don&#x2019;t have perfect pitch. Erika really wants to see you succeed and will do everything to make that possible", "[0.9] [Spring 2019] This is a very fun course, if you have the basics down. Erika is a great teacher, but benefits the relatively knowledgeable students much more&#x2013;her ability to help beginners is not as clear to me", "[0.85] [Winter 2019] Very difficult class but can be extremely rewarding. Erika is quite demanding, but she is the most wonderful professor that I have ever had. She knows what it takes to get you from point A to point B...you just have to be willing to meet her halfway.", "[0.1] [Winter 2019] It can be a bit demanding at times especially for its light credit load, but the 24 series is integral to one's development as a musician.", "[0.35] [Winter 2019] Erika is great and she makes ear-training a lot less painful than it could be.", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] Ear training has been the best gateway into understanding music for what it's really worth for me. You have to take ear training if you really want to discover what it means to know and be with music.", "[-0.05] [Spring 2018] Make sure you put time into it - the skills can be difficult.", "[0.9] [Spring 2018] Take it but be sure you've got your theory, piano, vocal, and aural skills up to par for the course!

This is such a useful class", "[0.85] [Winter 2018] Take this class!!! Erika is fantastic, and it'll make you a much better musician!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] This course is very useful if you are looking to improve your ability to hear & recognize scale degrees, chords and their inversions, cadences, and modulations. Keep in mind that the pace of this course requires a good deal of practicing outside of class/section to fully keep up with the material covered.", "[1.0] [Spring 2017] I found this class very challenging and demanding. However I think my ear training skills improved significantly which was very rewarding. This is not the sort of class where you can do well just by having good reasoning ability, like music theory. This class requires skills that come more naturally to some people. If like me, you are not naturally proficient in ear-training related skills, you have to dedicate a lot of time and practice to improving these skills. When doing the assignments it's important to focus on gaining as much as you can out of them rather than trying to complete them as efficiently as possible. It can be discouraging when you struggle with tasks that are a breeze for people with perfect pitch. However Erika is patient and accommodating of a range of skills, and I believe anyone can do well in this class if they dedicate time and focused practicing.", "[0.9] [Spring 2017] Great teacher, great class. I recommend it.", "[0.6] [Winter 2017] It's a very challenging course, and if you're struggling, your bound to not be alone.

She's very responsive and understanding. \n\nAdditionally, we created a nice community during this year of ear-training, so it was nice to see everyone participating.

Definitely harder than 24B, there's a lot of chromatic stuff that I found difficult, but nonetheless it was very fun to learn and I wouldn't say it was a considerably bigger time commitment than 24B (maybe an extra 30 min-1 hr a week or so).", "[0.8] [Winter 2021] This course is extremely fun, and you will improve your aural and sight-singing skills without even realizing it!", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] Erika is, quite simply, the best! It was such a pleasure taking both 24B and 24C with her over the past two quarters and watching her really get a grasp for teaching online.

I was lucky to have class with 2 other phenomenal musicians which allowed us to soar through the content and learn/listen to some great music! Cheers :)", "[0.55] [Autumn 2020] Music 24C is no cakewalk, but you will have a superhuman ear with enough time and effort.

That being said, I put my heart into these classes and have grown an INCREDIBLE amount, both personally and musically. I can do stuff now that I never thought I could. Erika is the best teacher I have ever had--period. She is brilliant. She is quite tough, but she wants to see you succeed. She cares deeply about the topic and about her students.  This class can be very difficult for some, like myself, but if you apply yourself and put in the time, you will see results. They might come slowly, but they will come, as long as you don't give up on yourself. Put yourself in the best possible position to succeed.

You'll learn a great amount about topics that you've never even considered before, so I encourage you to come in to the course with an open and excited mind!", "[1.0] [Winter 2022] Not a bad course, but not what I was expecting. Normally seminars are discussion-based, but most class periods Prof. Kretz would lecture without stopping for the whole 90 minutes, which usually was on very interesting information but meant that my classmates and I didn't really get a chance to engage actively during class time. You would also expect the material to be almost entirely about Southeast Asia, but I would guess only about half of it was, with some classes covering as varied topics as Kant, Aristotle, French surrealism, or Marguerite Duras. In ways I feel like I learned as much about French intellectual life in this class as I did about musical traditions of Vietnam. I don't think this was a waste of time, but I feel like the class was a little overambitious in its scope, and that Hans was trying to encourage us to develop an entirely new paradigm for how we think about philosophy of culture, listening to music, and reading texts. I don't think this is something that could be accomplished in a single class, especially one where the instructor gave us comparatively little that we *had* to do. So this class is a good class if you're willing to make it a good class. But I think it could easily rub a number of people the wrong way.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] Take it!

Dr. Kretz is incredibly knowledgeable and accommodating, and he does a wonderful job in sharing his enthusiasm for the material.", "[0.9] [Winter 2021] This class was incredibly informative and Prof Kretz is incredibly engaging. I learned about so many different art forms, and I really appreciated the discussion topics we had that encouraged us to really reflect on the type of art forms that are institutionally upheld and protected, what art forms are not protected, and other socially pressing topics that extend beyond just the realm of art. Definitely take this class if you can.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] Amazing, low-stress course I'd recommend to anyone interested in the topics, regardless of background or prior experience in music/art/philosophy! Work was minimal beyond showing up to class and being present, which was I was very grateful for during a stressful online quarter. Hans' lectures are very thoughtful, and he makes a very conscious effort to gear his lectures and discussions towards his students interests/motivations in taking the class. He seems more committed to thoughtfulness and personal interest than in formality of thought or writing experience.", "[0.6] [Spring 2020] really informative interesting class about cross-references between South-East Asian Arts and other cultures' arts as well as its underlying social/political/historical meaning/contexts"], "MUSIC 247K": ["[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Take it.

Maybe more helpful one-on-one, has plenty of ideas and guidance.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2018] Really interesting class discussions and thought provoking content. Awesome movies and the papers were manageable because they give you so much room to pursue your own interests.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2018] The meetings are really long and the discussions can be a bit dry."], "MUSIC 25": ["[0.85] [Autumn 2022] The class is extremely fun!

I found that the grading was generous, but Francois still provides helpful and critical feedback.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] Excellent course run by an incredibly knowledgable professor. The course content is very engaging and well-worth learning. I recommend this course to anyone even remotely interested in anime and Japanese culture.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2022] I would say it is a good class to learn and expand on the media of anime. Even if you don't know a lot about Anime there are aspects of the class that will get you introduced.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] I find the content of the course engaging just because Professor Rose does an excellent job of making it very engaging for the students. I will say it was kinda tough due to the early time for the class but I was always immediately energized when it came to in-class teaching.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2022] 10/10 course, take it if you can!!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] I LOVED THIS CLASS! Please take it if you are an anime fan and would like to meet other anime fans or just learn more about Japanese culture in general!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] Extremely relaxed and engaging class - Prof. Rose prioritizes that you have fun while working.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] Definitely the best and most enjoyable course I have taken at Stanford. Professor Rose is a very energetic and charismatic instructor and is truly passionate about the content of the course. The homework is light and the final presentation is manageable because of the preparation and practice you gain from multimedia analysis in class. Professor Rose also gives some wonderful feedback after each assignment.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] This is an amazing course to take if you're trying to learn more about anime in a deeper meaning. You get to watch anime during class so this is an awesome course.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2022] Best class I have ever taken in Stanford. Dr. Rose is truly a man of culture.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2022] interesting class! attendance is important, assignments can feel a vague sometimes", "[1.0] [Spring 2022] This class was so much fun! I'm an anime novice (had only seen 4 mainstream shonen prior to this class) but I had a great time. The course material and instruction is extremely engaging and it was so refreshing to take this class in-person at the tail end of the pandemic. Prof. Rose is very passionate about the topic and it shows in his teaching. The workload is pretty light and I honestly learned a lot more than I was expecting about Japanese aesthetics, storytelling, and animation/filmmaking techniques.", "[0.65] [Spring 2022] This is an absolute gem! Loved every second of it!", "[0.75] [Spring 2022] Great class. If you like anime this is for you. You'll learn a lot more about how to critically an", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] If you can, TAKE THIS COURSE!!!! Dr. Rose is a wonderful instructor. The material is interesting. The workload is just right. You come out of this class with both a greater appreciation of anime and Japanese culture. It's probably one of my favorite courses that I have taken at Stanford. 100/10 recommend.", "[0.65] [Spring 2022] Watch the anime early, so you have a lot of time to have your thoughts marinate. Some of the excerpts can be very challenging so its good to have time to figure out what you want to say.", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] This course is a great way to satisfy the A-II WAYS requirement. You learn a lot about Japanese culture and animation techniques.  Make sure to keep up with attendance and due dates, there isn\u2019t much flexibility for those", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] Take it! The professor is very passionate and does a great job teaching. The assignments are super manageable too. The only thing to be weary of is the attendance policy. He\u2019s very strict about tardiness and overall attendance and it\u2019s worth 10% of your grade. Overall highly recommend though.", "[0.25] [Spring 2022] Attendance is important!", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] It's a fun course worth taking. The homework and final assignments may take longer than you think, so beware of that fact. They aren't going to be necessarily as long as a PSET, but they just take time. That being said, the instructor is very kind and helpful.", "[0.75] [Spring 2022] Highly recommend for anyone who enjoys anime and wishes to learn about Japanese culture", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] Amazing class. Francois is a passionate and fun professor. Highly recommend.", "[1.0] [Spring 2022] This is a great class if you're interested in learning more about the Japanese culture and aesthetics behind anime. Classes were really fun because Professor Rose would show a clip of anime and then discuss the direction/meaning behind it, so it was a great way to get introduced to a variety of animes. The excerpts shown in class don't really focus on shounen animes that came out within the past few years, but it's totally possible to analyze a recent shounen anime in the final oral presentation. There four short written assignments throughout the quarter and a final presentation (in a small group), and the class prepares you well for those essays and projects. Professor Rose is also a great and enthusiastic instructor who clearly has a passion for the subject, which made classes really interesting. If you're interested in anime at all and have time in your schedule, I would definitely suggest taking this class!", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] it is so fun. it was truly a delight coming to class and watching clips of so many cool anime", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] Francois is a superb instructor who made Decoding Anime an eye-opening and extremely enjoyable course. I learned so much about Japanese aesthetics and how they play an integral role in the popular medium of anime, and all of the assignments were both reflective of what we had learned and fun to write up. If you're thinking about whether or not to take this class, I highly recommend taking it. You won't regret it!", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] Take it! Francois is an animated instructor who's dedicated to the class, and there are few better ways to start a schoolday than sit in class watching anime clips and analyses of those clips. It's also an excuse to watch anime and be productive at the same time, and it fulfills a ways requirement as well. Overall quite worth it.", "[0.5] [Spring 2022] This was a very enjoyable course.", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] An amazing class if you're interested in anime. I don't watch much anime, but Francois made the class so engaging and interesting that I still learned a lot.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] I loved this course with Fran\u00e7ois! He is such a fun, engaging lecturer, and the course material was incredibly interesting. I had almost no experience with anime before, but this class truly opened my eyes to the fascinating genre and made me appreciate Japanese culture so much more.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] This is an absolutely great course and the professor is SO FUNNY. Where else will you find a class filled with anime watchers where you get to watch and analyze anime for homework? This class increases your appreciation for each anime because it lets you look into the narrative, music, imagery, and other choices that the producers and writers make.", "[0.55] [Spring 2022] Interesting course. Not super easy. Francois Rose is great. Lots of discussion of Japanese aesthetics, so be prepared to analyze from that perspective.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] I highly recommend taking this class! Professor Rose is excellent; he has a deep understanding and passion for all of the material he covers. If you are a fan of anime this class is extremely interesting and fun to engage in.", "[0.8] [Spring 2022] Take it! The instruction from Dr. Rose is fantastic! Always engaging!", "[1.0] [Spring 2022] Best class at Stanford! Dr. Wrancois Wose is one of the nicest, caring, enthusiastic, and eccentric lecturers here. As an avid anime enjoyer, this class still broadened my perspective in anime. Would highly recommend to anyone, and it fulfills a WAYS-AII! Absolute MUST TAKE!!!", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] Definitely consider taking this course! Professor Rose is so knowledgeable and wonderful. I wasn't very familiar with anime prior to this class, having only watch one series with friends, but the course material was super accessible and I learned so much!", "[0.8] [Spring 2022] Great class! If you thought you had a good AP Language class in high school, this is a lot like that, but instead of analyzing rhetoric, you instead spend most of the class learning how to spot different Japanese Aesthetics and analyzing how different anime use these aesthetics to highlight different themes / points that the shows are trying to demonstrate.", "[0.5] [Spring 2022] Anime is fun", "[0.7] [Spring 2022] Highly recommend taking this course if you like anime. Francois covers some very interesting material, and it is very clear that he has much expertise in this subject. The text for this course, however, is highly questionable. It sucks that for assignments, we are required to quote from the textbook.", "[1.0] [Spring 2022] If you can, ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS. I watched anime before taking this class but you get to learn so much more about Japanese culture and art that made this a hidden gem of a class. This class was so popular it filled up with the first 10 seconds of enrollment opening, and the waitlist was filled up too so I consider myself lucky I got in so make this a priority when enrollment opens.\n\nAbout the class itself, you do 4 writing assignments throughout the quarter(about 2 pages each) but don't be misled, Professor Rose maxes what you write at 2 pages, so your analysis must be elegant and to the point. If you can, try to take this with friends because at the end you choose an anime and do a 20-25 minute recorded presentation, and you choose your groups of 3 people in week 2. Also, the anime you choose is first come first serve so try to have something in mind. Also as a heads up, shone/action anime(Attack on titan, demon slayer), are often much harder to analyze in the way Professor Rose wants you to so even if your favorite anime is attack on Titan/eren jaeger(lol) it might be a better idea to choose a slice of life anime because those are usually filled with plenty of aesthetic.\n\nTAKE THE CLASS! It fulfills AII ways and is not very stressful and you get an excuse to watch anime (:", "[0.7] [Spring 2022] Not quite what I expected tbh. I thought we'd get to analyze anime, but all we really did was focus on applying terms about Japanese aesthetic onto various clips. Every essay seemed like we were writing the same thing. Overall, the class is really easy though and the only downside is that it was at 9:45am", "[0.2] [Spring 2022] Interesting if you're into anime, but if you're not, you may feel a bit out of place", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] With Francois, this is a fantastic class that really gets into the anime itself. I had primarily only watched Shonen before this course but learned how to appreciate other genres and how different cinematographic and design and narrative choices lead to better appreciation of Japanese values and cultural aesthetics. It teaches you to look deeper than just the story and I'll really appreciate this class for teaching me that.", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] Francois is an amazing, upbeat, passionate instructor who provokes clever discussions and analysis regarding anime. While this class was taken online, it was still a pleasure to hear Francois lecture with such passion and knowledge about multimedia analysis and Japanese aesthetics. Overall, it was a great class. The assignments consisted of watching anime and writing analyses supplemented by evidence from our textbook. Francois was also more than willing to accommodate for both the pandemic as well as the racial injustice surrounding black lives, specifically George Floyd. This shows how Francois not only cares about the topic of this class but also the safety and wellbeing of his students. Would 100% take this class again.", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] This is an extremely interesting and engaging class, if you like to look into the deeper meaning of many Japanese anime and want to come to a better understanding of the thought that goes into it, this class is great! This class is also great for those who also enjoy breaking down film/animated shows/etc and analyze it.", "[1.0] [Spring 2020] TAKE IT. AMAZING CLASS. FRANCOIS IS LEGIT THE NICEST AND MOST PASSIONATE PROFESSOR EVER.  also, like, definitely put effort into your work because you get really good feedback and it's really eye-opening.This course is clearly run by people who truly love anime. I wish I could take it again", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] This is one of Stanford's gems. Francois is an incredible professor with passion and he truly makes class a joy to go to every single week! Take it!", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] A really well taught course that helps bring light to Japanese Aesthetics. This course is fun and interactive and the professor is a really great person.", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] Take it! It's very interesting and fun to talk about anime in this manner. Even if you are a newbie with anime, like me, it's a great way to start watching and get exposed.", "[0.85] [Spring 2020] Take it! Francois is incredibly nice, funny, and engaging.", "[0.65] [Spring 2020] Great class!", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] It is an amazing course and I recommend it to anyone. Francois is an amazing lecturer, and even if you aren't interested in anime you will love it by the end of the course.", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] Super fun!

It is such a fun class, learning and watching anime, and Francois' enthusiasm is great! He is so knowledgeable about Japanese culture and connects themes from anime so well to it, and is overall a great learning experience.", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] Interesting class, fun, and great way to fill ways", "[0.8] [Spring 2020] Great class, Francois really gives you new appreciation for anime", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] An excellent course! I had limited exposure to anime before this class, but I learned a lot about Japanese aesthetics and had a lot of fun. Take it with 2 friends so you have your final project group.", "[0.65] [Spring 2020] Pure fun! Take this class!!!", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] A really fun course! Professor Rose is a really great person and very approachable. The workload is light, the lectures are fun and incorporate a lot of examples from anime, and you learn new ways to approach and analyze anime. Overall, a fun and light class.", "[0.5] [Spring 2020] I only recommend taking this course if you really, really like anime. Unfortunately for me, I don't really watch a lot of it, so it was difficult at times to follow references and feel passion for the subject matter.", "[0.8] [Spring 2020] Take it! Francois is a sweetie and will enlighten you to the wonders of music and animation!", "[0.85] [Spring 2020] The professor is passionate and brings energy to the class. It was a pleasure learning from the Francois.", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] One of my favorite classes! I already loved anime but this class made it even better! We got to watch and analyze anime clips and discuss it. I'm so happy I took this class.", "[0.65] [Spring 2020] Was very fun, recommend if you're an anime nerd", "[1.0] [Spring 2020] Absolutely amazing. Came for the content and the WAYS, stayed for Francois Rose. He cares so much about the material and the students and is beyond genuine. What's more, he's got a super fun and quirky personality that kept me smiling throughout. The only other professor that rivaled this was Mark Applebaum in Music 8A. Both of these constitute my favorite elective classes hands down.   The content and presentation of material in the class is quite good. But most of all, I was able to change my perspective on anime: realizing that there can actually be an immense amount of depth in certain productions was a major eye-opener. Trash anime is still trash anime, and the stigma around anime will continue, but after this class I've gained a newfound sense of righteousness and confidence in my enjoyment of anime.", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] It is a wonderful class, and Professor Rose is so upbeat and during the online quarter I was always excited to go to class to have his positive attitude rub off on me. The class also helped me better understand how to look at and appreciate the elements of anime.", "[0.0] [Spring 2020] Take it! You have 4 2-page written assignments and one Oral presentation.", "[0.85] [Spring 2020] I really enjoyed the viewings. They introduced me to a lot of anime that I had never known or considered before. It was also enjoyable to discuss different interpretation with the class, which is a rare opportunity.", "[0.85] [Spring 2020] its a really good and chill time, super cool prof and you dont even need to start out a big weeb", "[0.85] [Spring 2020] Fantastic course!

Great professor. super funny & understanding when it comes to students work life balance 10/10 would recommend", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] Dr. Rose is one of the most energetic and enthusiastic professor I have ever met at Stanford.

This class is extremely interesting, and you will learn more than you think.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] Amazing class! Very interesting and very much felt like a 3 unit class. If you put in the work you will do well and learn more. Top 3 classes I have taken.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] It's a really entertaining class. Francois is super excited about anime and it really shines through. It's basically a film studies class through anime, which is pretty cool. I just wish it went more into the culture surrounding anime than just as pretty much a film analysis class (how anime studios are typically run, anime's business model, animator/studio spotlights, etc.) and how that affects the anime being created.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] It is an awesome class to help with two hard to satisfy WAYs", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] It gets you to look at animes in a very different way and to develop more appreciation. You will also discover a lot of great movies after the class.", "[-0.5] [Autumn 2018] The class itself is fun, but the attendance policy is harsh. You cannot skip more than two classes.

Best class that I've taken at Stanford thus far", "[0.8] [Spring 2018] If you are interested in anime to any extent, take this class!

Learned a lot about a topic I have a shameful amount of experience with.", "[0.85] [Spring 2018] Great class! Fun way to explore anime and some of the aesthetics of Japan and anime themes in general.", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] I never thought I'd find a class on anime, but here it is.

Highly recommended if you have even a passing interest in anime.", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] Amazing class!

Treat the project and the anime with respect and the audience will learn a lot about what could be your favorite show.", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] A very interesting, very chill course. Prof. Rose is the most animated and enthusiastic lecturer I've ever had at Stanford, and you can tell how much time he's put in preparing each day's lesson.   On top of that, you'll gain a deep appreciation for anime, and its cultural / aesthetic contexts. you'll come out of this class enjoying anime even more than you did entering it. it's pretty surreal."], "MUSIC 250A": ["[0.9] [Winter 2022] This course will be heavily dependent on your personal situation. If you have prior Arduino, programming, 3D printing and laser cutting experience, and not overly ambitious ideas, you can get away with very little work in this class. However, if you're looking to learn those things and have ambitious ideas, it's quite easy to sink 20+ hours a week into this class and sometimes more in the final week or so. I learned so much from this class, and would recommend it wholeheartedly. The teaching team really cares and having that support makes all the difference.", "[0.6] [Winter 2022] Take it! Its fun, challenges the way you think and opens your mind & eyes to what music can be.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] A greatly rewarding class and the perfect combination of technological/logistical aspects of design and the creative ones. One will learn a wide variety of skills and tools to bring their vision to reality.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] TAKE IT!! MUSIC 250A is the best course I've taken at Stanford. Romain is super knowledgeable, and he and Mike were really helpful throughout the entire course. Though I felt like I came in with less experience than many other students, I still learned a ton and felt like the class was a great way to push myself outside of my comfort zone. I couldn't recommend it enough.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Very intense yet rewarding class, it's crazy how much you learn and accomplish at one time. Having a background in Faust, microcontrollers like the Arduino or Teensy, or 3D printing really helps. The course gives you the opportunity to learn new programs and how to build things by incorporating them into your labs or project. However, it can take a considerable amount of time so it's helpful to start things earlier. Also, using your labs as a way to experiment with ideas for the final project will save you a lot of time to focus on the more creative aspects of crafting your instrument.", "[0.85] [Spring 2021] Take it. Amazing instructors. Will help you in every way; they did a great job even if it was remote. However, I would recommend you have some Electronics and Mechanical Design experience from before or else you will end up being frustrated!", "[0.85] [Spring 2021] This is an awesome and fun class, also challenging because a lot of ground is covered.", "[0.85] [Spring 2021] Take it! I got the abridged pandemic experience with Romain teaching from the countryside - and it was still a really creative and fun class. The projects are all well sized to get done in the time given and you get to try so many different things. It's very self-directed, so if you're looking for a lot of structure this isn't the class. But if you want to be pushed to make cool new things, do it!", "[0.65] [Winter 2019] Great class!", "[0.85] [Winter 2019] A really fun course! I would highly recommend anyone even slightly interested to take this!", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] This has been my favourite class I have taken at Stanford.

Also, the diversity of academic backgrounds of your classmates creates a great environment full of different approaches that will help stimulate your creativity.", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] This class is a lot of work, and it helps if you have either computer music or fabrication experience so that you don't have to learn both. But it's really fun.

Dr. Berger is very passionate about what he teaches which makes learning about it more enjoyable. There were some really interesting lectures that I remember in particular about piecing together puzzles Bach and other composers may have left in their music with unusual metrical patterns. For a 5 unit class this is a very reasonable amount of work. The major assignment is to design and conduct an experiment on music perception with human subjects, then write a paper and present on it.

They give you so much individualized and personal feedback on your project and really want you to succeed. The class in my quarter was only 5 people so it definitely has a seminar feel. However, people usually don't pay attention to lecture which about research in some tangentially related topic which is a shame. The two instructors helped me personally so much with my research and exploration. I never thought I'd be able to have such incredible individual guidance at college but this course was amazing in that respect. I feel like the course was a great survey to computational music, but that said the field isn't one for everyone. The research project is pretty back-loaded so be aware of that but besides that project there's basically no work which is amazing.", "[0.75] [Spring 2021] More than any other course I have taken at Stanford, the lax restrictions on personal project guidelines and small class size combined to make me feel valued as an individual and encouraged me to go far beyond the absolute minimum and view my project not as a class requirement, but as a personal opportunity.", "[1.0] [Spring 2021] This course is a very interesting survey about the intersection of music with conceptualizing music as data. Lots of good bits about history and what's been tried before and then many discussions about limitations of existing work encoding, analyzing, and otherwise representing musical data. If this area interests you (i.e. you're a data science person curious about applying methods to music, or a musician who loves math), then I definitely recommend this course. It's got great background and will fill you in to the state of the world now, who are some of the big players in the area, and it might help you think about what opportunities are left on the table should you choose to pursue those.

Kumaran talks a lot so be prepared to listen or muster up the courage to interrupt him mid-sentence. Take if you're interested in piano literature and being exposed to more piano pieces! I definitely found many keyboard gems through this course and I am eternally grateful for this. Learned so much in history about the pieces I have played, made them so much more meaningful.

Hey, I even became a music major because of this course!", "[0.4] [Autumn 2020] Highly recommend (especially if you can take it in person)", "[0.85] [Autumn 2020] Super insightful class, albeit a small one. Prof. Arul is very invested in Western piano literature and has a lot of knowledge on piano. Very chill class, although you do need to actively study for the midterm and final.

It requires the student to put effort and thought into assignments, but these are applied in the service of specific goals. These goals are sometimes technical, but often they prompt the student to widen-out their viewpoint, evaluate their convictions, and consider not just what they want to make, but also what they want to contribute to the world. It's one of the most consistently interesting courses I've taken, and the work I put in, while extensive, was extremely gratifying and worthwhile. I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in the role of design in life.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] It is a ton of work and time but I felt like the benefits were well worth it. I learned so much in terms of both technical skill and conceptual/philosophical understanding of design. Ge's instruction, advice, TA Julia's availability and knowledge, and the other students in the class also being creative, skilled, and motivated/productive were all great.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2022] A LOT OF WORK. Probably should have a background in coding.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] This course is a huge time commitment and severely lacks structure. On one hand, the course aspires to engage with notions like \u201caesthetics\u201d and \u201cdesign\u201d, yet there is no outside reading, little examination of prior philosophical thought or history in either domain, nor anything resembling focused, informed discussion of either topic, as one might find in a philosophy, literature, art history, or product design course. Lectures are informal, meandering, and repetitive, and lack any discussion or input from the class. The only reading is the professor\u2019s own graphic novel, which features rambling musings, including long tangents on his career and friends, illustrated with hundreds of photos of himself. There are some interesting ideas packed in there but each reading could each be about 1/10th of the length.\n\nOn the other hand, the course requires learning two specific softwares (one of which, again, is the professor\u2019s own work).\u00a0ChucK is not the only audio coding language available, nor by any means the easiest, most efficient, most powerful, or really close to the best in any way. Unity is powerful and interesting, but a huge undertaking for a beginner. The technical side of the course is where students could have benefited from a paced, structured development of specific technical skills. (Many basic CS courses take such a systematic, project-based approach to learning a language or software.) Instead, after a few generic tutorials, the students are instructed to use YouTube to learn what they need to know, with no further guidance. The TA is burdened with helping individuals self-teach haphazardly by wading through YouTube and forums.\n\nThe vagueness of the \u2018humanities\u2019 side and the negligence of the \u2018tech\u2019 side constitute a definitively mediocre class. Which is ultimately a shame since the material is interesting. Perhaps the course is too ambitious in scope. If you are interested in Unity, there is nothing offered in this course you cannot learn yourself, on YouTube, for free. The lectures, unfortunately, are a waste of time. By the end of the course, I noticed many of the grad students in the class had simply stopped attending lecture. I would not recommend this course.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2022] Potsmoking class, you will be thorry (thankful and sorry as Ge likes to say) to have taken it.", "[-0.5] [Autumn 2022] a lot of work, and unity is very painful", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] TAKE IT! Genuinely my favorite class I've taken at Stanford, really made me rethink a lot of my values in design and question why it is we design the things that we do.

I really can't recommend it enough. I have rarely ever been in a class where the instructors cared so much/made themselves as available as they did in order to help their students. Ge & Kunwoo are both wonderful instructors with a lot of wisdom to offer. This class does demand a significant amount of time, but ultimately you are your own worst critic in this course. I would strongly recommend taking it if you have any interest in game development or interactive digital art, or if you want to learn how to use Unity. Or if you just want to feel something / make something you're really proud of :)", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Kunwoo is a very good TA. He is so helpful, and Ge is a very interesting professor. I would highly recommend this course, though it is a lot of work.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] My favorite course I've taken at Stanford - I would recommend anyone with an interest in design and interactive experiences to take it. You learn a ton by actually building tools and toys. It's very exciting and self-driven.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] The work is a lot and a great deal of coding experience is required. Knowledge of both computer music and game design is also helpful.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] .Good for practice with Unity. Course is flexible enough to get what you want out of it, just be prepared for 4 hours a week of very sparse lectures and disappointment on the audio synthesis side of things. The music synthesis language used is the professor's pet project, no one other than him uses it, and it's ironically not designed very well, so just be thoughtful about which parts of the development pipeline you're putting your time towards.\n\nOverall would recommend if you're looking for a venue for doing cool audiovisual projects. big time commitment.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2021] Assignments are very open ended and you get out what you put into the class. I would say it's most valuable for people looking to do audiovisual work/projects in the future. It is tough using ChucK in the class because it's not used in audiovisual projects outside this class and most of the Unity progress you make is just through looking up online tutorials yourself.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Take 220A/B and at least CS 106B first or you will feel it.

Also make sure to go through Unity and Chuck/Chunity tutorials as early as you can. They'll help you greatly.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2021] This is a very self-motivated course, and there is definitely a steep learning curve to Chuck. There's definitely a range in skills within the class since there were a lot of people my quarter that had taken previous CCRMA courses with Ge and already knew how to program in Chuck and Unity, so for someone not coming from a CCRMA background, it was definitely a shock during the first assignment to see how polished people's presentations were. BUT - this is also what makes the class so interesting since the projects people create are just so interesting, and I haven't seen creative technical projects executed like this in any of my other CS classes. Each project gives you a lot of flexibility conceptually, but just be aware that the only tools you're really allowed to use are Unity and Chuck, so if you want to learn other audiovisual programs, this class might not be the right place to do that. I still had a lot of fun using Unity and definitely learned by doing. There isn't a ton of formal instruction on how to program in Unity/Chuck either, so make sure you're ready to do a lot of Googling, office hours, and self learning to accomplish the projects.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] This course is a lot of work, but it's worth it! The projects were really fun to work on but could be time consuming. Class with Ge was always thought-provoking and inspirational.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Take this class!!! If you\u2019re interested in music, programming, gaming, and/or creative design projects, you gotta take this class one quarter. By far my favorite course I have taken in my 4 years at Stanford. Ge is a passionate instructor who genuinely cares about his students and teaching. And Kunwoo is an extremely knowledgeable, approachable, and awesome TA. The only warning I\u2019d give is that the class requires a lot of your time, so please don\u2019t take it during a moderate or heavy quarter or you\u2019ll be quite stressed. Take it with a lighter load and you\u2019ll get the opportunity to genuinely enjoy the class.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2021] Make sure your other classes are easier/lighter in work! The more you put into this course, the more you will get out of it. You can do okay just ticking the boxes and getting the projects done, but it will be worth your time to put your all into your work.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] Great class! Take it if you're interested in pushing your understanding of design and in getting experience with Unity/ChucK.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] This class is very much catered toward graduate students. A lot of the material is expected to be self-taught and the level of the students varies greatly in the class. It's a lot of work, but the projects you complete are all super cool. Definitely don't take this class during a busy quarter -- you will not enjoy it unless you can spend time and energy on it.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] You will work really hard and gain a tremendous amount as a result. It is very challenging and therefore very rewarding. The prof and TA really care about the students and the course and are deeply invested. It's a pretty remarkable journey.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] This course is very technically demanding, but it is not a technical course. The focus is always on design in the most holistic sense. You need to have the resourcefulness to learn the technical aspects more-or-less on your own. \n\nIf other CS courses teach you *how* to code, this course gives you the design tools to think about *what* and *why* to code. \n\nIf you give this course the time that it requires and have confidence in yourself, you'll be amazed with what you accomplish.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in audiovisual design. I had zero background in music or visual design programming coming into this class as a Symsys HCI major, and I feel like I've gotten so much out of it. It's definitely one of those courses where you get out what you put into the course.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] Ge and Kunwoo were a joy to work with and I love how much support and agency they gave to us, especially at such a weird time in our lives. I definitely think with this class, you'll get out what you put in, so just know that if you want to create cool and exciting stuff with Chunity you're going to have to put the hours in.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2020] Great class as always with Ge! I'd recommend taking 220B before this if you don't have experience with ChucK. Also, get ready to brush up or learn Unity pretty quickly.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] Challenging, but worth it!  It's obvious Ge is a polymath. He expects a lot from you and this might make you feel overwhelmed at times. However, because he is a polymath, his teaching is pure gold and magic. You will engage with music, computing, and design in ways that make you speechless. You will also explore what it means to be a humane designer, and how you might become one yourself. It's one heck of an interdisciplinary course, and that's the beauty of it. Be prepared to think like never before!", "[1.0] [Autumn 2020] If you think you?re interested in this course in the slightest, TAKE IT. This is easily one of the best classes at Stanford. I feel like it honed so many skills so well in 10 weeks without it feeling crammed. I learned a ton about design, design ethics, ChucK programming, and Unity all in this one course. The projects are also great practice in software design, especially if you?re really committed to object-oriented design principles like I tried to be.  Projects are done in Unity. If you?ve never used it before, I?d say this class is an excellent introduction--it certainly was for me. It?s simple enough to pick up to a point where you feel fairly proficient with it after the first project, and yet it?s powerful enough to create incredible audiovisual experiences.  The workload is probably pretty manageable, as well. I say ?probably? because it really depends on how out-there your project ideas are. I went with ideas that weren?t necessarily the most intuitive to translate to code, and I also had some last-minute (i.e. morning before the presentation) major changes with my final project that dragged out the time spent working. Other than that, weekly reading responses are pretty brief (400-500 words).  If you?re at all hesitant because you think you?re too ?STEMmy? and not ?fuzzy? enough for the class, but you really think you?re interested in the idea of it, I?d say this class is a perfect fit. I was in that position myself as someone who initially second-guessed themselves about their own creativity, but by the end I was feeling a lot more confident--so much so that I?m planning to take more classes with Ge! If you?re really worried, just know that even when you try to rip off other ideas like I did, the result seems to always end up looking way different and cool in its own, unique way.  Lastly, Ge is just a fantastic instructor all-around! If not this class, take some class with him. In this Zoom U quarter, he made 256A feel like the greatest Twitch stream I?ve ever been in. That was partly because of his excellent Zoom setup, and more importantly because of how engaging the lectures are. Ge?s also a great source of feedback and ideas; use that to your advantage!  tl;dr: the class is great, Unity is awesome for projects, workload is solid, you don?t have to feel very artsy going in, and Ge is fantastic.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2020] If you don't have much programming experience but are very interested in creating artful interactive audiovisual experiences with Unity and ChucK, I would highly recommend this course but encourage careful deliberation over if you truly have the academic and mental space for a big challenge. The instructors put you first and encourage you to pursue your own interests and values, and the class created a great studio environment during crits. I learned so much through projects with a lot of help after coming in having no idea how I would make these projects, which is a major step for me and research. However, as wonderful as the teaching team and class is, I personally experienced high stress when I felt I really had to rely on others and didn't understand everything.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2020] The principles you'll learn in this class will apply in your life at Stanford and beyond. That's what school should be!", "[0.6] [Autumn 2020] A great course, quite a lot of work. Especially with the compressed term, it was really fast-paced.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2020] Such a great course! It was a great space for me to explore ideas and build skills - I feel empowered by how much I was able to do with ChucK and Unity. After each of the three projects, I thought it was the coolest project I had ever made. no joke. Also, Ge became a mentor for me - he's a really thoughtful person.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2020] Definitely take it, really worth it!", "[0.0] [Autumn 2019] .", "[0.75] [Autumn 2019] Great course. Take it if you want to make cool artsy things and learn skills.", "[-0.25] [Autumn 2019] Very hard course! Don't take it with a heavy courseload. You do get a lot out of it in the end", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] This has honestly been the most influential class for me in terms of figuring out future plans (career wise and academically). It's crazy cause it was supposed to be my \"low-key, fun\" class this quarter, but no other course has made me appreciate my technical skills as much. The stuff you (and your classmates) build is seriously cool, and Ge got jokes. Highly recommend if you have the time to commit.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2019] Do it!  You'll learn so much!", "[0.0] [Autumn 2019] Phenomenal course. Ge is an incredible professor.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Take it if you are looking to really push yourself creatively and technically, and make some really cool stuff. Ge is a really fun, engaging, passionate lecturer and genuine human being who expects the most from you and pushes you to be creative and do the most.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Fantastic course on the intersection of design principles, computer music, and video games. Ge has written a very creative textbook and is a passionate instructor. I recommend having at least intermediate experience with writing code, as the class assignments require working with several different languages/environments: C   & OpenGL for the first assignment, C# scripts in Unity, ChucK for audio programming, and HTML for the class's assignment websites. There's a lot of work to do each week--the class could be considered 5 units--but I found the challenges worth it upon finishing and presenting our projects. This class built my confidence in being able to envision, design, and create unique audiovisual projects primarily by myself. The in-class critiques for milestones and finished projects also fostered a uniquely collaborative spirit between classmates.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] If you are interested in designing interesting computer music interfaces, or even more generally are interested in design for digital media forms, this is an excellent class.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] If you are interested in visual programming and audio take it. Especially if you like game aesthetics it would be a perfect match.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2018] You will know more about unity design, great course!", "[-0.4] [Autumn 2018] be fully into it or don't take it.  Ge is amazing, and the TA Jack is phenomenal as well. but if you don't care, you won't do well.", "[0.35] [Autumn 2018] This is a fun, yet very demanding class.  I highly reccomend!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] This course assumes you are a good self-learner. It is a design course that requires considerable programming skills, but you will only receive generous but limited help on the technical side. Be prepared to search for online tutorials on your own.", "[-0.85] [Autumn 2018] Really tough! The most difficult class in Stanford! Makes me sad and desperate sometimes.", "[0.25] [Autumn 2018] Be prepared to spend a lot of time on projects outside of class. It's almost inevitable that you'll find yourself wanting to spend more time than you've allotted on some of the assignments.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2018] It's awesome", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] Be prepared to put a lot of time into this class, but it's a lot of fun and totally worth it!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] Workload comes in waves. You will be calm for a couple weeks and suddenly spending 20 hours over two days doing a project. Just be prepared to allocate time that way! People in the class are so talented and many make incredible projects; it's cool to see their work!", "[0.75] [Autumn 2018] If you have a design idea, really lean into it. It's not about showing off your technical chops, but rather about creating a good design.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] Do not take this with another intense CS class unless that's all you're doing. This is an intense class, as you must learn the tools on your own time, but the in-class discussions are awesome. Ge is a great/fun lecturer, and you can make some cool stuff with the assignments!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] One of the best classes I have taken at Stanford because I love project-based classes and spending a lot of time making awesome things. No exams or essays, just designing some very cool things with audio and programming. I'd recommend having at least 107 under your belt because you need some stamina to get through the learning curves of each project platform. Amazing class but will require a lot of effort.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2018] Great class to learn about design. Lots of creative agency. Be wary of taking this without much programming experience though.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2018] Takes a lot more time than you think", "[0.75] [Autumn 2017] This class will totally change your perceptions about software design. Assignments take up a ton of time but the end products are usually very cool looking audio software(s). Absolutely no emphasis is given to good coding practices and I think that's fine since this is way more of design class.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2017] I would highly recommend this course to anybody with interest in art and have basic skills in programming. It is one of the best courses I have ever taken.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2017] The workload is heavy. Don't try this if you know nothing about programming! But if you did, you might learn a lot from the homework assignments.", "[0.2] [Autumn 2017] This course is more reliant on programming than on music, so if you're not already fluent in compiled languages, there'll be a learning curve", "[0.95] [Autumn 2017] Great course to expand into new domains of skills with (CS, sound design, HCI) and get a grasp on design principles. Remember that design isn't just about your vision of a product, but how that vision is received by others. Critiques are your best ally in learning this, and this class does that well.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2017] Take this course! Its a good amount of work but is really great.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2017] Great course that I think any engineer, computer scientist, future product designer could learn a lot that they will not see anywhere else! Helpful for thinking about design in a very different way from more \"feature list\" based methods.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2017] You get out what you put in. If you're willing to go all out on the projects, you can seriously learn a lot. Ge is crazy good, and Jack (the TA) was also crazy good. At times the class can feel like an immense amount of work, but it's SO worth it. Seriously. Like actually.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2017] This is a great class mostly because of the freedom of the projects, the amazing work of the other students you get to observe, and of course, Ge. It is a lot of work to get anything out of it but you will really explore how to closely tie visuals, interactions, and conical elements together in your creations. The things we build here are astoundingly delightful and interesting.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2016] The more programming (C  ) you know going in, the more you will get out of this course.  Focuses on higher-level programming using available frameworks (Juce, Faust, openFrameworks).", "[0.65] [Autumn 2016] Romain and Tim are the best.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2016] Brush up on your C   beforehand, and maybe take a look at the JUCE framework.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2016] if you enroll, make sure to get some study before the term begins on things like C   basics", "[0.5] [Autumn 2016] This course requires a lot of work every week but you have a lot of independence to do something you like", "[0.8] [Autumn 2016] Definitely a worthwhile course if you're interested in computer art or computer music.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2016] This is the best course I have ever taken, take it if you want your life to be better than before", "[1.0] [Autumn 2016] This was by far one of the best classes I have taken at Stanford. SO educational and SO much fun. It provided a great survey of computer music topics (low-level audio programming, sound synthesis, audio effects, etc.) to someone who had little experience in the field before. The class was mostly geared towards graduate students who already have plenty of computer music experience, but the instructors were extremely willing to help me (an undergraduate) through things that were new for me. Honestly such a great class. I enjoyed every minute of it. It's the kind of class that you will want to spend all day in.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2016] Great course. Doesn't require a lot for programming skills but you need to be creative.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2016] Very good. Very interesting. Very rewarding.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2016] Definitely should take this if you have some background in programming and are interested in audio and music.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2016] Having a clear creative idea for assignments and the final project greatly improved my overall experience. When the creative process was slow, the assignments were much more difficult to get through."], "MUSIC 257": ["[0.8] [Spring 2022] Good class if you're interested in sound design, auditory processing and plasticity in humans, and game development. The range of topics is so wide that it takes a lot of work to understand/implement all of them at a satisfactory level, but that's why this course is 5 units. It helps a lot to have experience with Unity game engine and either matlab or python.", "[1.0] [Spring 2022] About the class: lecture is about neuroplasticity and the neuroscience of sound (from the biology of the ear to higher-level systems of learning), weekly individual DSP coding labs about sound/signal processing, weekly group projects building increasingly complex games (leading up to VR game with some type of external sensor input), 2-3 essay sets on neuroscience topics from class, a presentation about a game you like, a debate about if videogames should be able to be prescribed like medication for certain neurological conditions, and the final project (group project about topic of your choosing, must have VR/unconventional input component, make a research poster). It's kind of a lot and v disorganized.\n\nGood things: \nPoppy is incredible and has so much knowledge about neuroscience/sound/games/cool neuroscience startups to share, and she is eager to engage with student questions and reaches out to provide high-level guidance for the final project. She is one of the coolest people I have ever met. Lloyd is also ridiculously cool and is probably the best TA I've interacted with--he knows a lot about game development and accessibility, and was a helpful sounding board for our final project which made it into a much better game. He is v helpful in OH too. His mini tutorials on sound etc and help on DSP labs were invaluable. You will learn about some really cool stuff in this class, namely basics of game development theory and some stuff about the brain and case studies of startups in the neuroplasticity industry. \n\nNot as great stuff:\nThe idea of the class--to combine neuroscience of sound with videogame dev and brain plasticity--is a cool concept and I was excited for this class all year because of it. But the class didn't live up to my expectations. My main gripes were 1) the lecture material is completely inaccessible to anyone who doesn't have an incredibly specific background in biology and neuroscience and sound/signal processing. I tried in the beginning of the class to ask a lot of questions to actually understand everything but I realized that it was fruitless and I would have to spend all lecture asking questions to understand anything so I just zoned out. I learned a few core concepts. Lecture slides were not helpful. Essay sets were incredibly difficult because they're based on inaccessible lecture content. At least Poppy is a generous grader. 2) You are taught some game dev principles, but you're never actually taught how to use Unity or how to connect the headset or how to connect the sensors. You're basically given an assignment and loaned some equipment and given a deadline and set free. We were assigned one hour-long tutorial of how to make a pong game which was helpful but too specific for a newbie to learn the underlying principles or processes. I know unity has a wealth of documentation and tutorials online, but tbh I don't have time to research and find specific tutorials on top of everything else. If you have some experience in Unity, that might be fun for you, but I had none and so it more often felt frustrating and fruitless and a very poor pedagogical move. What ended up happening is that the one person in the group who had prior experience in Unity or game dev just did the entire technical side, which meant that people who didn't know game dev didn't learn game dev, and didn't get much out of the labs. If I could give one piece of advice to the teaching team it would be to TEACH US HOW TO USE UNITY. I am glad that I now have some unity experience (from being in a final project group with other game dev newbies) and it's actually super fun and I want to build more games going forward, but I wish they had just assigned us a relevant unity tutorial for each week's material or had a single lecture on unity basics. \n\nOverall: interesting concepts, got some cool knowledge and experience out of it. Glad I took it and would probably take it again, but I wish I had known what I was getting myself into.", "[0.7] [Spring 2022] Although Poppy and Lloyd are perhaps the most understanding teaching team I've seen, the course is at times very confusing and just feels a bit weird. First and foremost, Poppy is extremely smart and really understands her field. She is a great resource and will always be there for her students. \nAbout the class:\nThe focus is geared almost 100% towards the auditory system and the neurobiology of how sound works. All of it is extremely interesting, but it is very complicated, and don't expect to understand everything if you don't have a solid background on the subject. You also have weekly Labs that deal with Digital Signal Processing, where you probably have to learn how to do them in OH, and you have to code games, yet no class teaches you a single line of Code in Unity. You also have to write up two Essay Sets and make a presentation on a Game. The final project is very rewarding, but it is hard and expectations are high, overall it's quite a bit of work.", "[0.05] [Spring 2022] I randomly found this class and decided to take it because of the \"neuroplasticity\" portion of the title. As a symsys major, I learned a lot about the work being done in my field and was finally able to see a potential career that I am excited about. HOWEVER, be weary that this course is not completely focused on this topic. Instead, there are a lot of lectures on sound (sound perception, how sound travels through the ear, etc.), and there is a LOT of game design/coding. You work in groups, so if you are a proficient coder, you might be carrying a lot of the work load. If you are not, you'll find yourself with very little to do (and feeling guilty about it) or having to learn a lot on your own outside of class. There is very little support in helping students acclimate to the gaming systems, so the projects are very time intensive. There are also small weekly coding assignments and essay sets (without much guidance).", "[0.65] [Spring 2022] If you want to learn a very in-depth version of neuroscience based primarily on auditory pathways and hearing, and get some Unity experience, take this class. The Unity work is largely self-taught, however; but if you're willing to put in work (especially for the final project) you'll see satisfying results!", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] This is an unusual class. I will say first of all that in the title \"Neuroplasticity and Musical Gaming\" I was much more interested in the \"Musical Gaming\" than the neuroplasticity. However, this class spends a lot of time talking about neuroscience and not that much talking about video game design or musical design in video games. So I probably wouldn't recommend it unless you're actively interested in neuroscience. Poppy is an incredibly smart person, but not necessarily always self-aware? Like there'd be student presentations every so often and although the period afterwards was theoretically open to questions, usually Poppy would jump in right away with her questions and then immediately move on to the other parts of class, the result being that sometimes the voices of me and my classmates were pretty shut down.\n\nAlso, a brief aside: a lot of the hardware in this class works a lot better with PC than with Mac. I have a gaming PC so I was fine, but I know many other individuals and groups struggled when they didn't have a PC. So make sure someone in your group has a PC (that person will then have to do all of the hardware interfacing aspects of the project, which can be the hardest part, but what can you do).", "[0.85] [Spring 2021] I really enjoyed this class and Professor Poppy is awesome", "[0.5] [Spring 2021] The course is paced very quickly and covers many different areas. Having a background in at least 2 of 3 areas of the course (neuroscience, game design, signal processing) would be extremely helpful, and almost mandatory.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] Great for students who are interested in working with Unity and playing with VR/AR. etc. Great opportunities to interact with other students of various interests. Poppy is incredibly passionate about her work and has a lot to share in her field and about the world.", "[0.65] [Spring 2021] You learn a lot of interesting things in this class, although sometimes it feels like the lectures don't relate at all to the assignments or projects", "[1.0] [Spring 2020] I loved this class, but ngl it's a little weird. The lectures were deep-dives into the auditory system and neuroplasticity (like wayyy deep), but then 90% of the outside work was about game development. The workload was a lot but manageable if you enjoy game development. We had to build one game per week (cross your fingers that you like your group mates), do one coding/sound assignment per week, and sometimes a little reading or short answer. Poppy moves a little fast at times on really advanced topics, but overall she's really helpful, and she supported us in making some really great products.", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] Really challenging and time consuming course, but also very rewarding. Poppy is incredibly smart, but sometimes her intelligence clouds her ability to teach since everything tends to lie behind walls of jargon and terminology. Just make sure to ask questions when confused!", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] GREAT class - may have changed my career path! You'll learn a lot of Unity/C# (I had only taken CS 106a before this, and I had to work hard to keep up, but I was able to) and a lot about how we perceive music, biologically and neurologically. Maybe my favorite class I've taken; definitely some of my favorite projects I've done (and I'm an ME major!)", "[1.0] [Spring 2020] INCREDIBLE. This class is amazing, and you learn so much about neuroplasticity and how games can be used to change the way we perceive, think, and act. The focus of the class is on the auditory route, but not to the exclusion of other ideas. It's helpful to have some coding background but there is no need to have any neuroscience experience. Poppy is an amazing instructor and has such interesting insights on this topic and so many others. Finally, the thread of ethical use of neuroplasticity throughout the course is great and refreshing. Poppy clearly cares deeply about how this knowledge is used, and I have never been in a class that manages to seemingly cover a wide array of topics in considerable depth while talking about the ethical implications of the science. And on top of it all, you get to make some cool video games! I highly recommend for anyone who is interested in the intersection of technology and human behavior or perception.", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] if you have some unity experience and want to do good in the world, I highly highly recommend this for you!! things move fast but if you have game making experience (best prep class for this one is MUSIC 256A with ge) then you'll gain a lot! If you don't know unity, I recommend getting some exposure to it through other classes before heading into this one.", "[0.8] [Spring 2019] This is a great and unique class, and you should take it if you have the opportunity. Poppy is literally a world expert in these topics. However, coding experience should be a mandatory requirement given the demands of the labs and building games.", "[0.8] [Spring 2019] I thought it was an amazing class! It really helps you think differently about technology and video games. However, I would only take the class if you have some experience with coding.", "[0.6] [Spring 2019] learning how to use unity and the various devices you need to build games takes a TON of time. It can be very frustrating when you get bugs or your game is unable to work. However, just budget your time and ask for help. You get what you put in. I am very glad I took this project course but it was a lot of work. Very worth it though!", "[0.75] [Spring 2019] This course is amazing! Unlike any other I've ever taken at Stanford. Be prepared to do a lot of work to get games working, but it's definitely a \"you get out what you put in\" class", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] This class really should list at least CS106B, if not CS107 as a prerequisite/corequisite. There is a lot of coding in this class, and because the partner assignment (save for the final project) is random, you may find that a lot of times your partner will let you down because they don't know how to code. If you know how to code, be prepared to carry your partners through the labs. If you don't know how to code, be prepared to be carried, or, even better, learn how to code. The class is very multidisciplinary, which is cool because it helps people learn about different topics, but I think it is difficult for people to suddenly pick up coding if they have not done it before, especially given the fast pace of the class and the fact that along with coding, students in this class also have to learn about neuroscience, etc. Otherwise, the topics brought up in this class are super-interesting! The projects are fun, and you will gain access to a lot of hardware that you can use to craft the ultimate brain-changing game!", "[0.35] [Spring 2019] Lot of work. Be ready for steep learning curve", "[0.0] [Spring 2018] Try not to take too many other classes at the same time", "[0.55] [Spring 2018] Take it if you are passionate about these fields.", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] This is an amazing, interesting, and extremely fun class, but it's a lot of work. Only take this class if you are prepared to commit to lots of time working on projects outside of class. Every lab is done in groups (usually randomly assigned) so it's very important that every student in the class has a similar amount of interest and commitment to the material. If you sign up for this class but aren't prepared to commit, you are letting yourself AND all of your classmates down.", "[0.8] [Spring 2018] It's such an interesting course, and I highly recommend taking it. The professor and the TA are both really invested in the learning of the students, and you get to do really cool stuff in that class and for projects.", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] Absolutely take this class!

We could play with our theories and ideas from our backgrounds, and Ana always encouraged us to pursue them while giving suggestions on how to develop them. Her vast experience with these texts and theory also made us feel comfortable with interacting with these texts.

Dons and kas, kiai... All of it comes together to create expression. Expression of emotion, whether it be joy or struggle; expression of a message. Taiko's capability of expression truly compels me. Of course, all music and other artforms strive to do the same, allowing artists and their audiences to engage in connection, communication, and expression. But there's just something about taiko. It's raw, it's grounded. Friendly to both proficient players and enthusiasts alike. Actively intertwining with both community and identity. Echoing a common sound that resounds in all of our hearts.\n\n\n\nYou know, I took an IntroSem about taiko this quarter and I think taiko is special because it has all of these things.

Everyone was very genuine in discussion and we explored various types of art from around the world. The art and readings explored in this class are very abstract and it took me a few classes to be comfortable with the depth of the art involved, but it was a very rewarding process. Jarek's enthusiasm and open-mindedness makes the class very exciting and it was very intriguing to hear peers' perspective on the art as well. The weekly assignments and readings are very doable and you learn how to use the basics of various editing/art software to make your projects, which you can use for personal use in the future. Overall, the class refreshed my view on art drastically and I'm very glad I took this class (even though I delayed my math sequence for it, it was worth it!)", "[1.0] [Autumn 2021] I LOVED THIS COURSE WITH EVERY FIBER OF MY BEING!! Biggest takeaway was helping me step out of my comfort zone when creating or viewing multimedia art. I entered this class with absolutely zero music, animation, or videography experience but it taught me to make art within all those fields combined into multimedia pieces. I also can't view multimedia art the same anymore, this class transforms the way you interpret art. And Jarek is super sweet and caring to all his students and really loves what he does. If making art in any way shape or form interests you (the assignments give you tons of freedom), its a must take.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] This was a great course - take it!

The professor is absolutely wonderful and your classmates will be wonderful too. In all honesty, this is probably the best class I have taken in my life so far.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Take it! This class is such a nice spot to slow down and appreciate art. Jarek is so sweet and knowledgable, and really lends an interesting perspective to art. Sometimes the art will go a little over my head, but I love how we can really discuss our thoughts and reflections on different forms of art.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] This course was very illuminating in terms of understanding what we conceptualize as sounds, images, and words, and most importantly, what we consider to be art. Jarek is a wonderful instructor, always open to all kinds of interpretations and perspectives. The class develops a very inclusive environment as students reveal more personal parts of themselves through projects/assignments. Frankly, it was not what I had expected the class to be; there are a few readings which are quite interesting, and the sheer exposure to different artists' work throughout the course is surprising. You will see types of work that are not usually spotlighted. Take it if you are interested in combining technology with art. Classically-trained artists might find themselves racking their brains to understand the more contemporary styles.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Super fun course!

Professor Kapuscinski is incredibly sweet & knowledgeable - I learned SO much", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] This is an AMAZING class!

Great class", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] Professor Jarek is so knowledgeable and insightful, but equally genuine, open and caring. There were moments in class that I felt inferior for not comprehending and appreciating some of the material that was presented at the level I wanted, but professor Jarek not only helped me understand; he helped me recognize the potential in my limitations, and move toward turning that potential into reality. Before taking this class, I had no clue how to analyze and appreciate art beyond its superficial appeal, and at the end of every single day, I would walk out of the class with a new eye for everything I see, hear and read. Not just that, because the assignments are all project-based, this class gives one a crucial opportunity to reflect upon one's values and one's journey in their stage in life, and express it through art. This class is as challenging as you make it, but it is so worth it. I cannot believe how much this class has changed my perspective on art and life.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] Amazing course, very interesting material that encourages the class to express very diverse interests and thoughts", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] This course was my most formative course this semester without a doubt. While it may be easy to overlook based on how it comes off/the contagious pragmatism the Stanford freshman atmosphere preaches, this class develops your mind and spirit on a level that so much more impactful than your average/mainstream classes. I already notice changes in how I interact on all frontiers, though mainly socially and intellectually, based on the values and principles instilled in me by Jarek's seminar. Mindfullness, playing devil's advocate, considering deeper meaning and layers to all endeavours are more widely-applicable skills that one comes away with after taking such a class.

Dave's instruction is great, Jonathan's is harder to follow and I hear Julius is impossible to learn from. All three are brilliant but it's really easy to get lost and not speak up. I found this class tough to really internalize, but part of it is the material itself. For context, I'm a MST student who is there for the art/design/philosophy/music/interaction side of things and not the DSP/acoustic research side of it. BUT I still liked this class because Dave and Doga (TA) stayed so late every class to make sure everyone got the help they needed. CCRMA faculty and TAs are the nicest people ever and actually just care about your learning. So if you have to take this class vs another hard class, consider this one if only for the huge amount of support the profs will give you.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2019] Great class for learning more about the underlying mathematics of the Discrete Fourier Transform and Digital Filters. If you have not previously had exposure to the mathematics of digital signal processing, it may take a few weeks for the concepts to sink in. For this reason I'd recommend starting on the homework early-- wrapping your head around some of the theory and Matlab problems will probably take longer than you expect. Don't be afraid to ask the instructors and TA(s) about concepts you're stuck on! They will be very helpful with walking you through conceptual roadblocks.

But the class is not very organized.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] Great class, Profs Abel and Berners are super cool and incredibly knowledgable.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] This was definitely a communal effort. Find out when most students in the class are able to work on the assignments, and work on them together. There were 5-8 of us who got pretty close because of working on all the assignments together.

The instructor is very jolly, kind, and understanding as well.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2020] If you don't know how to program in python, don't fret!  It wasn't difficult to learn python passively while learning the fundamentals of the DFT.  A good math background is necessary though.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2017] The course offers both a good introduction to more advanced DSP audio and music applications and great basis for mathematics of signal processing.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2017] This is a fast paced course. Do all the readings and watch all the lecture videos, and just bear in mind that many of the classes will confuse you if you haven't done signal processing before, since we cover a lot of higher-level stuff that is pertinent to the topic but not necessarily to the exams or homework. The pace is too quick to even know what questions to ask from what the instructor is saying, so make sure you do the reading/lecture video watching thoroughly and formulate your questions from this.

Homework takes longer than it should because you have to teach yourself all of the material at home while doing it. Grading is not consistent. I came in with a lot of prior knowledge relevant to the class and still found it challenging and frustrating because of the way it was taught.

This question is silly, because it's not an optional course, and no one who isn't required to take it is going to take it.", "[0.4] [Winter 2021] It's good. Jesse does a very good job, but he doesn't have x-ray vision to see how committees will view your application. All he can do is suggest how he would view applications as an evaluator, and apply common sense (if you promise to blow up the department, that might not be well received).", "[0.75] [Autumn 2017] It's rather expected that all dissertating students take this course; that being said, Heather does an excellent job leading it. I just wish she had been firmer about what we should/shouldn't be doing exactly.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2017] This is a tremendously useful class for anyone finished with their quals. It's also a rare opportunity to hear colleagues give formal presentations on the full scope of their current work."], "MUSIC 332": ["[0.75] [Winter 2022] fun class. If you have thought a lot about literature philosophically it will be even better.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Take this course! It's a wonderful chance to read great works of literature and connect them to engaging secondary texts. Both John Holliday and Joshua Landy are phenomenal instructors. They're brilliant, care deeply about students, and create a learning environment that pushes you to think deeply. Reading load is of course high but manageable.", "[1.0] [Winter 2022] This course is definitely one of the best courses I have taken at Stanford so far. Professor Landy and Professor Holliday are both fantastic instructors (in fact, they are truly the best): They have created a very welcoming and friendly classroom environment, encouraging all the students to ask and discuss all sorts of questions related to the readings each week. Both the literary and philosophical readings for each week were carefully chosen by the instructors, and it was very rewarding and intellectually-stimulating to discuss the course material with the fellow students and the two instructors. It was also a pleasure to write a final paper at the end of the semester. Definitely take this course if Professor Landy and Professor Holliday are teaching it again in the future.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] This is a great course structured to respect your time in engaging with the readings and your thought. The assigned work was very reasonable, particularly in combination with the weekly meetings that were well organized and not overdemanding. It was a good experience that helped my learning about the content and my connections of it to other work.", "[0.75] [Spring 2021] The readings are important and valuable, but because the class tries to cover so many different things and includes people from so many departments, it's hard to see how it all fits together or what the class's goals are. As a result, class discussions could sometimes be a bit aimless. Use of class time could also have been managed more effectively.", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] This course faced the difficult prospect of threading the needle between three adjacent yet distinct disciplines. I think the professors did a better job of philosophizing poetry than bringing music into the conversation, although the occasional musical interludes were interesting. The course could have benefited from a more deliberate lesson plan for each week, so that the relation between the different constitutive elements (and each week's texts) could be seen more clearly. The (very knowledgable) professors would often hold forth, but in ways that sometimes felt tangential or digressive, rather than oriented toward establishing a coherent design. Class meetings frequently ran late, which was more irritating in the Zoom environment than it would have been in person. Most of the assigned readings were excellent and provocative, but many fell by the wayside in discussion. Still, I would recommend this course for any student in any of the three fields with a prevailing interest in aesthetics and the relations between media.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2019] It's a great course to learn methodologies. It's a helpful class to begin thinking and working philosophically.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2019] What a duo! I couldn't have imagined a better pedagogical combination for this course. Mark and Lanier bring two distinct yet amicable perspectives to each discussion, and each of them plays to the strengths of the other.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] This seminar changes every quarter, so there's not much that I can say that will transfer to you, future student.  Content-wise, I wish we had an initial overview class that simply set out some canonical approaches to aesthetics to have in the background for the rest of the quarter.  If you're interested in thoughts regarding the professors: Mark and Lanier were great this quarter. They have very different styles, and the interplay of the styles was very entertaining, and often enlightening. Classes were always led by one professor, and I found that Mark leading with his more open-ended, loose style, supplemented by Lanier's very astute and structured interrogations led to the most productive sessions. I.e. Mark has great questions, and Lanier has great answers.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] Please, please, please take this course. Mark and Lanier know how to distill complex arguments in entertaining and insightful ways. We read interesting, idiosyncratic texts that changed the way I saw art.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2019] Worth it, but make sure you have the time to do the readings", "[0.45] [Spring 2019] Try to come up with a topic of interest early and explore it as you write your paper. I found myself wanting more time to explore the topic I did.", "[0.65] [Spring 2019] I think it's an interesting concept, but it varies based on who is teaching it. I wish it had only been one instructor, so there could be a clearer pedagogy", "[0.45] [Spring 2019] Take it if you're interested in philosophy and literature, especially poetry!", "[0.25] [Winter 2018] Probably the most unique part of this course is the chance to write a book review for a final project, if you choose to do so. It's a skill that is overlooked completely for most graduate students.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2016] Highly recommend - highly stimulating ideas, and a great variety that gives a helpful view of the broad range of issues and interests in the study of literature.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2016] Anderson and Landy are great for leading lively discussion, and they're both extremely accessible and eager to take up any issue. We get to squeeze in an impressive number of neat topics (though some of the topics seemed to be handled somewhat brusquely). At times, students from disciplines talk past one or another (or more often, the discussion skews heavily toward comp lit or toward philosophy (the former more than the latter), while students trained in the opposite discipline are confused about what's going on)."], "MUSIC 34N": ["[0.9] [Spring 2022] Honestly a pretty fun, easy class. Sometimes the lectures would get dry, but you get to sing every class which is fun.", "[0.25] [Spring 2022] It's a fun introsem! If you get the chance to take it, consider doing so! If you're not interested in Broadway musicals, don't; you're not going to enjoy it if you don't know what's going on.", "[0.75] [Spring 2022] Class is more entertaining if everyone participates and joins in on the conversation. It is a fun class to learn about musicals more in-depth than just their music and lyrics.", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] Good overview of broadway history as well as conceptualizing popular shows - also just a fun opportunity to learn about shows you may not have been exposed to before !", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] This class felt like a waste of time but it was worth it in the end to see Dear Evan Hansen live at SF Broadway for free.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] Definitely take it, this class is super fun and professor Grey is great!", "[0.45] [Spring 2022] If you have a background in musical theatre and/or listen to musicals often, this class you won\u2019t teach you many practical things.

Musical field trip was really fun :)", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] Great course for those interested in Broadway and musical theater more broadly. A great primer on how to analyze different musical numbers in shows. Also, great teaching quality and you get to listen to songs in class so overall a great class and would recommend.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] This coarse was amazing. I enjoyed every second, and I couldn\u2019t say more amazing things about the Professor. He cared about his students, and taught the class with a calm and enthusiastic energy. The material was interesting and manageable.", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] I highly recommend taking this course to anyone interested in learning more about musicals. Even if you're not interested in music as a field of study, it is a great way to learn something new or turly understand your love of musicals.", "[0.75] [Spring 2021] this is an easy class to fulfill the WAYS - CE requirement. not really a lot of work!", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] Super interesting content! Workload is pretty chill, just a few presentations and quizzes. Take it!", "[0.65] [Spring 2021] It's an interesting class if you are a fan of musicals! Something to be aware of is that it's more of a lecture class than a discussion class, despite being an introsem.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] Take it! I really loved the course, and I got to have a much deeper appreciation for musical theater. The class definitely caters to everyone regardless of musical/theater/Broadway-watching background, and Prof. Grey covers a lot of interesting stuff. Some of the classes may go a little slow, but it's a really chill class. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys listening to/watching musicals.", "[0.25] [Spring 2021] There's not as much listening/learning about specific musicals as you'd hope, but you learn about the history and the type of songs and the layout of musicals.", "[0.85] [Spring 2021] Take it! Prof Grey knows so much about musicals and their histories. You get to listen to a lot of music, and he does some lectures asynchronously. There really wasn't too much work, and the two big projects are super fun and can be done as a group or solo.", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] Tom Grey is really passionate about broadway, musicals, and performance and it shows!! This is a great class if you know a lot about musicals or are relatively new to them, the professor makes it fun, and you will learn a lot about broadway history. Really interesting!", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] It's a great course that lets you explore fun musicals in an academic way, and deepened my love of them!", "[0.1] [Spring 2020] very fun if you are a fan of Broadway productions, but sometimes the history was a little boring and Professor Grey sometimes gets off topic or rambles past the end of class. can be frustrating if you don't find the topics interesting.", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] Pretty chill class, lots of little projects based on interest. Could be cool if you are really interested in musicals! Gave me the chance to look back more closely at shows i like.", "[0.8] [Spring 2020] It's a great class. If you like broadway, you will like this class. If you want to learn about broadway, you will like this class. It's more time consuming for someone who doesn't have any prior knowledge (of shows). But even if you do have to watch shows for assignments instead of recalling it from memory (as for someone who does know a lot of shows well), it's still really not that time-consuming.", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] This is a fun, relaxed introsem. Professor Grey is a really kind professor.", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] Absolutely DO NOT take this course. It is by far the worst course I have taken at Stanford and probably one of the most useless courses I have taken ever. I am such a huge fan of Broadway and even though the Carta reviews were not great, I thought it would still be fun to talk about theater and it would be an easy class to fulfill a WAY. Although I was right about the easy part, the class had no structure whatsoever. Most classes we would present \"projects\" (basically just researching a musical and summarizing it), which Prof Grey would then comment on. However, there was no discussion other than between the presenter and Prof Grey. It was impossible to develop a discussion about musicals and honestly we probably could have had a more enlightening experience by creating a zoom call with everybody in the class and just having a conversation. This was also disheartening because this was the only introsem I took and I thought introsems were supposed to be seminar/discussion format. I learned absolutely nothing from this class and the disorganization and lack of planning was beyond frustrating. Also, although Prof Grey is a super nice person, he did not have the knowledge of musicals to teach this class. There were so many times when he would say things that were objectively incorrect about musicals. For example, once he said something incorrect about the plot of Hamilton and when the students called him out,  his excuse was that he isn't very familiar with the second act, but he's seen the show in person and we just spent TWO WEEKS presenting on Hamilton. To be fair, it may have been better in person since it was quite an unusual quarter and adapting to online must have been challenging. So this is all solely from my experience during COVID. But based on my experience, there is a difference between an \"easy A\" class and a class that genuinely makes me wonder how in the world I could be paying tuition for it. This class is definitely the latter.", "[0.75] [Spring 2020] This is a fun course where you get to relax and learn about musicals. If that's your thing, take this class.", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] This is an incredibly fun class that doesn't take up a lot of time and is ideal for anyone interested in musical theatre. You get to learn about Broadway musicals to just the right amount of depth, and get to discuss and collaborate with other enthusiastic students.", "[1.0] [Spring 2020] This course was fun. I highly recommend this course if you enjoy musical theater. The workload was pretty minimal and the work that I did outside of lecture I found enjoyable as I like the subject matter. There is also something special about diving into a subject that you enjoy with others who share the same interest. This course focused on the history of Broadway as well as the structure of Broadway musicals.", "[-0.55] [Spring 2019] It was a small class so I got to know other students with similar interests, which was fun. Otherwise, the class was not at all what I expected or wanted from a seminar about musicals. We mostly focused on the history of musicals and the different song types found in musicals. I wanted to do in depth analysis of shows and their symbolism and meaning, but instead we just learned about song types. So much more could have been done with the class, its a shame. Also, there was always one or two people dominating class discussions.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] Contrary to what you might expect, this class does not have any creative component. Although the material covered is interesting, it does not delve very deep, and the class lacks structure. Also, one of the aspects of this class I was most excited about was getting to see musicals performed around the Bay area, but this prospect turned into nothing (the only show we went to see was Ram's Head's 'The Addams Family'). Personally, I think this class is good if you're looking for an easy WAYS class, but disappointing if you are looking for actual intellectual and creative study of the Broadway musical.", "[0.45] [Spring 2019] It is an easy class to get rid of your WAY-AII or WAY-CE", "[0.85] [Spring 2019] This class could have been executed a lot better.  While it is chill and doesn't expect much work, there is a lot of memorization of dates, people, and types.  Also, it would've been nice to analyze the deeper meanings of plays, and also go see some productions.  Overall, could have been executed a lot better.", "[0.75] [Spring 2019] This class is really only for people who like Broadway and take the class with their friends. The teaching style isn't organized and a lot of the information is irrelevant. It goes too deep into the specifics of things that don't really matter and glossed over huge parts of history.", "[0.8] [Spring 2019] Great course for anyone interested in musical theater", "[0.8] [Spring 2019] I loved this class! Definitely take it!", "[0.55] [Spring 2019] The class isn't well organized. Sometimes it felt like the material we were covering was repetitive, and we didn't have time to get through all the material. But it's a nice lowkey class and doesn't have much work.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] Take this class--but take it for the right reasons. You don't need to have any talent (but prof grey def likes if you can sing/play instruments). This class is a complete disaster zone but honestly in a kind of fun way. I would have preferred if the class was better organized and I could have learned more, but it was still a nice thing to have in my schedule during spring quarter.", "[-0.25] [Spring 2019] Don't take it, teaching's not great and we were enticed in at the beginning by the promise of seeing shows in the city which never materialized", "[0.6] [Spring 2019] Cool class if you like broadway", "[0.75] [Spring 2018] I'd say it's a great course, please more musical field trips.", "[0.8] [Spring 2018] A really fun class.

That is not true. It is definitely an advantage to be familiar with musicals, songs, etc. I don't think that's a good thing, it should be open to all. Prof. Grey is alright. He doesn't finish his sentences and interrupts himself and that's annoying to listen to. And when you present, he'll hijack your presentation probably and interrupt you mid thought. If you keep talking, he'll just talk over you. So be prepared for that annoyance and disrespect. That said, this is an easy class for three credits and AII. But I didn't learn much in this class. I mostly just did homework for other classes during it.", "[0.2] [Spring 2018] This class brushes over a lot of interesting history, but you don't really go into depth about specific musicals unless you really do it on your own for the presentations. It's more about the history of musicals in general, and less about studying specific musicals.", "[0.9] [Spring 2018] It's a fun class and not too much work.

This class is a trap. Don't fall into it.", "[0.65] [Spring 2017] This course is very cool in that it gives you opportunities to see theater on and off campus. If you are looking for an in-depth history of theater course, this is not necessarily the course for you. It tended toward describing and analyzing specific musicals in depth instead of larger theatrical history.", "[0.2] [Spring 2017] This class is not what it is advertised to be. You likely will not do any performing or actual work on songs, and you simply learn about song types, musical genres, and a little on the evolution of Broadway.

I felt like there wasn't a overarching theme or direction to the class. It always just seemed to be \"music can heal people,\" but there wasn't any structure to the class otherwise. The misleading thing is that the class is rarely about any biological responses in a modern medical lens - it's more \"this is a medical and cultural tradition that introduces music in some way.\" The readings are long and tedious. I liked that you got to pick and choose which homeworks to do (there are 8 assignments, and you choose 5 to do). The part of the class I enjoyed the most were practical demonstrations of an instrument, or some cool musical traditions from around the world. But the lectures themselves are very unfocused. Dr. Gill will start somewhere, and then veer into some random social issues that are tangentially related to the topic but don't really have to do with the main theme of the course.

I'm not particularly musically-inclined, but I had such a great time learning in this class.- you cover so much and it really changes your perspective on the relationship between music, culture, and medicine.", "[0.4] [Autumn 2022] This is an interesting course that touches upon music and healing in many cultural and historical contexts. All the assignments will be writing based, and you will have a few readings and musical excerpts to dissect each week.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] A great course for WAYS, Dr. G is very passionate!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] I thought it was an interesting course. If you're here for the humbio side of things though, it's more music based. There's a lot topics and examples from different cultures which was cool, but I believe could have been more culturally sensitive at times. That being said, I think the prof did a great job of approaching each topic and was very knowledgable.", "[0.3] [Autumn 2022] This class was ok I needed it for a WAYS.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] Take this class if you want to learn about some interesting topics in the realm of ethnomusicology.

No exams. Class attendance is also mandatory, with 3 free absences. Dr. Gill is a good lecturer who has done some very interesting work in the past. The course staff are very kind and accommodating.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] I liked how th assigments in the class were set up, so that you had the flexibility to rite about the topics you found most interesting. The reading before lectures is interesting but took me a long time to read because I am a slow reader. The lecture content is also interesting but it can be hard to pay attention for the entire hour and a half. However, we we get to listen to music, listen to the professor sing or play instruments, and do vocal exercises the class is really engaging. Additionally, I liked that Dr.Gill acknowledges the white, heteronormative, industrialized, and colonist context research may come from and that we exist in.", "[0.4] [Autumn 2022] The content feels closer to anthropology rather than analyzing music. The workload is manageable, as it's nice to only do 5 out of 8 weekly homework responses.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2022] Take this class! Professor Gill is a great professor.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] I think this class was a great unique course to take beyond normal major requirements.

Learned a lot and not too much workload.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2022] Very interesting course.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] The class topics are very broad, but Dr. Gill still goes very in-depth about everything, so you really walk out feeling like you learned a lot. Another one of my favorite things is that Dr. Gill discusses a lot of non-Western music. The assignments are also not difficult, so you learn a lot without the stress, which is sometimes hard to find at Stanford. The homework also helps you engage more with the class content and they're very well picked by Dr. Gill.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2022] Dr. Gill is very passionate about ethnomusicology, and is also a skilled musician. As my first foray into ethnomusicology, I have to say that a lot of the topics covered were not things I will probably spend much more time engaging with in the future, but I did enjoy many of the case studies about healing and music."], "MUSIC 390": [], "MUSIC 398": [], "MUSIC 399": [], "MUSIC 4SI": [], "MUSIC 40": ["[1.0] [Autumn 2022] This course is really useful for understanding historical music and the contexts from which it arose. Kirstin and Danny do an awesome job of providing a varied mix of textbook and first-hand sources. They alternate class lectures between discussion, listening to music, talking through the history, and examining scores. They're really understanding when you have questions or need help. I think the most interesting part of the class is the historical and social contexts of the music. Danny and Kirstin did an amazing job of exploring what sort of religious ideas, political pressures, social issues, and artistic movements gave rise to the different musical styles we studied. This class was also the first time I accessed the special collections. Completing research on historical manuscripts was a really amazing experience. Even if you haven't completed that kind of research before, Kirstin offers a lot of support to guide you through the process.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] A great course. Kirstin makes sure to check in with everyone once in a while, which is very helpful!", "[0.35] [Autumn 2022] When it says 4 units, it really does mean 4 units. You like it if you apply yourself.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] If you take it with Kirstin (and our wonderful TA Danny), it's one of the most fulfilling and fun classes ever! We learned so much in jut 10 weeks and had the flexibility to explore our interests and how they relate to medieval music. We also got to see choir performances, visit the listening room in CCRMA, talk to Robert Huw Morgan and Steve Sano in MemChu, and learn about everything from transcribing manuscripts to space acoustics to the evolution of songs. It really provides a solid foundation for the Western art music that so many of us play in the music department, everything makes so much more sense! Also, the class was very cohesive and we all made some new friends. Definitely take it, 10/10!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] Kirstin is a wonderful professor and the course is very organized and thorough. Be prepared for a decent amount of work and reading. It's definitely a time commitment but the content is interesting!", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] If you are interested in learning about music history pre-1600, I would highly recommend taking this course. At times it can be a bit reading heavy, but what to look for in the readings is always made explicitly clear: you never feel like you are just doing busy work for the sake of it. Kirstin clearly cared very deeply about the content matter and essentially provided support on-demand in whatever form you needed. Also, on-campus field trips (to CCRMA and MemChu, for example) not only made the course more interesting but helped us to see certain topics in action that otherwise we never would have seen (given that this field of music is rarely talked about). There were certainly some topics that are more confusing and difficult to follow than others, especially considering the fact that most people--musician or not--have very little exposure to this period of music history. Unfortunately for that sake, the class moves very fast. If you miss a topic (especially one that keeps coming up), you may feel behind overall. However, the resources are there. Ask for help, do the readings, and you will be good to go. Also, the ending research paper and creative project are both enjoyable and valuable, but can be time consuming. Start brainstorming right away!", "[0.6] [Autumn 2022] Lots of readings and class discussions. Kirstin and Danny are amazing.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] kirstin and danny are a great teaching team.  i would definitely recommend taking the class with them :) \ni would say that the quizzes can be difficult, but there is opportunity to retake and improve, which i think really fosters a learning environment and takes the potential stress away", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] Have fun with the research and creative project. For many music students, music history may not be something they use day to day. But if you can connect it to your art, connect it something that very well could impact your art going forward, you will get a ton out of this class. Start early on these two projects and think critically about how the projects will help you as a musician as a whole, not just in the context of the class. Have fun with it!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] The content is challenging as it's largely unfamiliar to most, but you'll leave the class loving the topics. Plan to spend a good deal of time on readings / listenings to truly understand them. When Jesse says listen an hour a day, listen!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Jesse is one of the best at what he does. Though the content will be foreign to most musicians, with enough dedication and a healthy flexibility in perspective, anyone could enjoy this class and its music.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2021] Jesse is definitely among the most knowledgeable in his field, and Christina is like the coolest TA ever! They are both so good at what they do, and are very engaging on top of that as well. Jesse never fails to explain an overarching narrative of what's going on. The course reader in particular is well made, and there is a deliberation behind the documents and works he chooses. Medieval and renaissance composers did some crazy things you wouldn't expect for pre-Baroque era, and you'll really get to examine how and why. There's lots of cool music! Expect the class to be quite small-sized, but you'll really get to know your peers that way. \n\nThat being said though, this is definitely one of the most consuming A-II classes - so don't be fooled by the lack of Carta data or no description (I'll assume Jesse updates that soon) The exams are very very intense - there's listening portions where you'll not only have to recognize the name and composer of the work, but also the ways in which the work stands out within a broader timeline. There are also these things called Style IDs and you'll have to use knowledge from works you examined before and apply those concepts to answer a series of questions on works you haven't really looked at yet. So be wary :) There are also weekly quizzes, and the very concept of those can feel stressful at times, even though they are definitely doable and are worth very little (they'll help keep you check before exams though). And I did wish I spent more time on my writings, because you have to be very precise about what you want to say, and let go of concepts you may take for granted like tonality, or originality. And DO YOUR READINGS. This class is very well-structured, and he always gets done what he wants to get done (thanks to the 90-minute length). Overall, really engaging course, fantastic instruction", "[0.2] [Autumn 2021] You must stay on top of your readings.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Jesse\u2019s passion for and expertise in pre-1600 Western music is truly apparent and it is such a joy to learn from him. This course can be incredibly demanding at times, but you will learn a lot and it will really feel like your knowledge has grown by the end of the quarter. I would recommend this course to music majors or anyone who\u2019s interested in pre-1600 Western music!", "[0.15] [Autumn 2020] I really wasn't expecting to have so much work and energy needed to be put into this class. The subject material is quite dry, and since there is a lot of work, you are really immersed in it. Jesse couldn't be more knowledgeable, but his class sure is difficult. The exam was quite stressful, the papers are heavy, and it is quite difficult to gauge how you stand in this class. Honestly, if I didn't have Christina and Lorenzo as my AMAZING TA's, I'm not sure how long I would've made it.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2020] It is tough but super interesting. To be honest we had some amazing TAs so your experience may vary depending on that. Would not take with a heavy workload. Jesse is amazing though and super knowledgable", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] I was initially uninterested in early music, but Kirstin made the class really cool! She's really organized, enthusiastic about the material, and accommodating. The big project is research with manuscripts from Special Collections, which is a privilege. The class did require some more time and effort than I was initially expecting, though.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2019] This course was a monumental time commitment, even when not completing most of the readings for the course. Keep in mind that even though this is a 4-unit music class, you should NOT take it unless you need to for your major/minor. Still, it's a very enjoyable class.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Kirstin is a phenomenal teacher. She really cares about each and every student, her use of Canvas is impeccable, and every class period is a delight. She makes students feel rewarded for doing the readings and participating, as the discussion is that much richer and planned out when the class does the homework. Would highly recommend!", "[-0.65] [Autumn 2019] Absolutely do it, but only with Kirstin teaching it.  Without her the class would be terrible", "[0.7] [Autumn 2019] Take it! There is never an uninteresting class session with Professor Haag! You will find yourself falling for Medieval and Renaissance music like never before. It's an approachable and fun course!", "[0.45] [Autumn 2019] Definitely take it with Kirstin. She is an extremely great pedagogue and is very, very organized. I wasn't interested in the course at all, just taking for the requirement, and I can actually say that I learned a lot. Readings are burdensome at some times in the quarter though.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2018] Find a good study habit and make timelines!!!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] The best thing you get out of this course is the music! I have a great new playlist now. The class can be a lot of work and you have to be prepare to memorize a ton of music and material that can be tricky at times.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2018] The course is very demanding, really more like 5 units than 4, but worthwhile for development as a musician and understanding of cultural and historical developments", "[0.85] [Autumn 2017] This class is very interesting because it exposes you to music from the medieval and Renaissance periods, and most people (even some musicians) are unfamiliar with this kind of music. It's a lot of work, but the assignments are fun. Every night for homework, we get to listening to a selection of pieces, and the assigned readings are pretty short. We also write lots of short essays, but these essays  are very personal, not analytical. They allow you to go in depth about yourself and your music listening experiences.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2017] This is a very interesting course on music history that really focuses on our experiences listening to the music. The workload is not too heavy. Mostly it includes short readings from the textbook, songs to listen to, and weekly short responses. Overall, a very good introduction to the topic.", "[0.35] [Autumn 2017] Take time out to do all of the work. Some of it seems like busy work.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2017] Its a great class and Victoria is a very nice teacher", "[0.8] [Autumn 2016] For the love of all that's good, keep up with the readings and listenings. Ask questions unhesitatingly!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2016] This class helps you develop a number of really important skills, in terms of thinking critically about history and analyzing music. Jesse sets high expectations for himself, his TAs, and his students, and that's a large reason why this course is fantastic. Jesse is incredibly passionate about the material and explains it so clearly. Advice for future students: take notes on the reading before coming to lecture (you will retain so much more this way), do the reading before lecture (if you don't, you will get lost), beware of bias in the Wright textbook, make flashcards for all the songs (yes, you actually will have to know all the things discussed in lecture), study really hard for the midterm and know composers/dates for the songs, pay attention when doing manuscript work (you won't develop important skills if you zone out). The course augmented my appreciation for early music, and I can't recommend it highly enough. It becomes more worth it and more enjoyable with the more time you put in.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2016] This class is rumored to be a LOT of work. Not gonna lie, it is. However, Prof. Rodin has been working for years to make the course more manageable and I was surprised by just how reasonable it was. He recommends spending an hour a day on the class and if you put in that time you will be golden. Lectures are super engaging (if you're prepared!) and you will learn a lot about a lesser-known period of music history as well as the issues surrounding how it is studied.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2016] It's a lot of fun, but also a lot of work! Be prepared to put a lot of effort into the class!", "[0.8] [Autumn 2016] It's never too early to start preparing for the final exam. As you will learn, memorization isn't useless - staying on top of the course material (there is a LOT) will help you formulate your own insights, draw connections between concepts, and just generally make the course worthwhile."], "MUSIC 405": ["[1.0] [Autumn 2021] Bissera is a wonderful mentor who encourages the curiosity and wonder of her students and challenges them to refine their intellectual scholarship. She really encourages rigor as well as creativity, and supports her students but also is not afraid to call them out and provide a historical framework to check opinions or speculation against \u2014 something so invaluable and that isn\u2019t common enough here! Both her written and verbal feedback are always extremely thoughtful, and shows she carefully reads or listens to our work; she gives specific suggestions for improvements and what resources would be relevant to our interests, drawing from her huge wealth of knowledge.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] I would highly recommend this course. The topic is endlessly interesting, the course is well structured, and it provides a great challenge for those who want it.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] I recommend this class! You get the opportunity to focus on a single site, approaching it from many different angles. It is a chance to dig into completely unfamiliar material and discover for yourself the many ways it speaks to us. Don't be intimidated -- everyone brings something different to the seminar."], "MUSIC 41": ["[0.6] [Winter 2022] Professor Hadlock is just pure joy", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Professor Hadlock is a fantastic instructor and I found most of the assigned readings incredibly interesting! The course's focus on opera was a bit heavy to me, but I would still recommend this course if you're interested in Baroque and Classical music history!", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] Professor Hadlock is amazing!! I didn't expect to like this course but I loved it.", "[0.0] [Winter 2022] Lots of small readings and writing assignments basically every class, class time is a big discussion.", "[0.85] [Winter 2021] Heather is very passionate about this course and the material. I wish we had an opportunity to be reminded of key objectives, composers, events, etc. that really shaped this period of music history, because I did not make a ton of cohesive thought between materials and topics sometimes.", "[0.4] [Winter 2021] Definitely take it. Very manageable with a heavy course load.", "[0.8] [Winter 2021] Dr. Hadlock is wonderful and so is Elea, our TA! The class is more fun if everyone talks and participates. There is quite some reading, so be prepared, but the class and assignments are really chill. Be prepared to learn and have an open mind.", "[0.1] [Winter 2021] You learn what you expect to learn. If you want to familiarize yourself with music history, this is the class.", "[0.85] [Winter 2021] Nice, casual course on music history! Prof Hadlock is great and the workload is very manageable.", "[0.7] [Winter 2021] What a transition from MUSIC 40. Prof. Hadlock truly is such a sweetheart and her classes were always so enjoyable to be in. However, I don't know how much music history from 1600 - 1830 I learned. This might just be accentuated from the influx of content that MUSIC 40 has, but it was a bit harder to see the bigger picture.", "[0.6] [Winter 2021] Professor Hadlock is a very enthusiastic professor who will teach you a lot the more you put into the class. Even though the work doesn't seem like a lot, don't make the mistakes I did and take it in a busy quarter, or if you're schooling and working at the same time! If you do, you're gonna wanna retake/audit the class later for personal enrichment, even if your transcript says you passed.", "[0.25] [Winter 2019] A lot of tedious discussion-based classes, and be prepared to do a lot of reading and listening", "[0.5] [Winter 2019] It may be confusing about how the class is structured, with respect to what information is covered. But the course allows you to think and discuss the music as well as the various contexts that surrounds it.", "[0.6] [Winter 2019] I would advise against taking this course unless you have to. To be honest I feel like I really didn't learn much at all from a class that's supposed to be a survey course; we had good discussions about social issues and very specific concepts in classical music, but there was hardly any coherency, and I didn't get a good understanding of the period at all, just some very specific and random issues that we zoomed in on. Like I don't think learned a single new composer, we basically only talked about Monteverdi, Bach, Handel, Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven", "[0.0] [Winter 2019] I don't think there are many people who take this course without it being explicitly required of them...", "[1.0] [Winter 2018] This class is a great, small class if you want to delve deeper into Baroque and Classical music. The listening assignments are very enjoyable, and preparations for class always force you to think more deeply about the material and help you better understand it. Professor Hadlock is also a really nice and passionate teacher! She's very approachable, and if you have questions, she always gets back to you with clear and helpful answers.", "[0.5] [Winter 2018] If you are looking to get an overview of music from 1600-1830 you will likely not get it from this course. This course offers a musicological perspective and everything is very much focused on the cultural and historical contexts rather than the music and the composers. Lectures are based on discussion about vague questions posed by the professor. Also be prepared to spend a lot of time on really intensive assignments that can pop up on some days. There are small assignments for every class whether they be reading   listening or reading   listening   writing. Exams will test on all of these assignments including a listening portion and written questions about the readings which were often primary sources or musicological articles.", "[0.9] [Winter 2017] Do not expect learn anything from the lectures-- they are nearly always poorly organized. At best, write down what's on the blackboard at the beginning of the lecture; even the smallest bit of trivia without being elaborated on has a good chance of showing up on later examinations.

The course is mostly a guest lecture format, which means that every lecture usually is presented by somebody different. I do not think this is effective at all since the material is all over the place. Perhaps it's useful for people who would just like to dabble in a bit of each topic, but there are ultimately no real cohesive narrative weaved by the different topics, just different ideas floating around.  The biggest issue is the lack of focus in application - the title (Singing: How it's done, how to learn to do it, and how to work with people who do it) suggests entirely application but only a few lectures really addressed that. A couple lectures that I found useful were ones that addressed breathing (Greg Waits), working with singer groups (Steve Sano), and a minor section of physicality (Nova). These particular lectures had components of clear directives in terms of how to sing or work with singers.  Here are some things that I found ineffective/could be better: -I found biological components of the voice to be fairly unrelatable to the application of singing, at least in how it's presented. For example I now know the existence of a resonator, but I cannot explain how to use it properly -Dr. Kwang Sung's presentation was interesting but had too much that wasn't applicable information. the main takeaways were that there are many ways to hurt your voice, here's how to avoid it. How did the exploration into all the different symptoms your vocal folds can develop supposed to help me understand how to sing or how to work with singers? It was interesting to see but I consider that knowledge to be more on the side of trivia. -I liked the topic of physicality being a part of singing (Nova's lecture) but the stretches were the only useful takeaway (which was very applicable). Her approach was a bit too abstract for me to understand (e.g. if you are in tune with your body this way, then you can achieve better singing vs. do this specific thing with your body to sing better) and I would have preferred explicit directions on how to improve my own physicality. For example, her exploration into a particular joint around the head/neck still has me very confused - why is this important and how do I do anything with it? -Bryan's lecture was enjoyable because he was such an energetic presenter, but contributed very little to the objective of the course. Most of the lecture was historical in nature - almost zero applicable takeaways. -the focus on registration also had similar issues - we've walked away knowing how different registers sound like but very little insight on how to achieve them. e.g. how do I coach someone who doesn't have use of their head voice to use it? If this course was called how to listen to singers then it would fill that gap quite well"], "MUSIC 65A": ["[0.9] [Autumn 2022] This course was fun to take to build up your confidence to sing in front of a group of people who you get pretty comfortable with throughout the quarter. In terms of singing technique, I only learned how to breathe and I don't feel that we did much after the first four weeks because after that we mostly focused on the performance aspect of singing to work up to the final (which is to perform a song).

I feel like my singing, especially vocal strength, has improved a lot over the quarter. The first few weeks focused on doing group vocal exercises and warmups and listening to clips of singers. Starting from the fourth week, we sang individually and got personal feedback from Benjamin and the other students. There's a low-pressure final performance in the 10th week where you perform the memorized song you started learning in week 4 to your classmates (*we could pick any song we wanted and switch any time between week 4 and 10 too - you're not bound to a song), but it's not too scary!

Fair warning that, partly because the weekly hour is split six ways, partly because the second half is mostly about performance, you won't get passed the absolute basics (which took me ten weeks to nail down anyway, for the record).", "[0.15] [Autumn 2022] Singing in front of others is hard, as you are very vulnerable. However, it gets easier after the first time!", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] I honestly loved this course. I was really nervous at first because I didn't know what to expect in class format, but I found what we did super effective. It was nice to be in a supportive setting with other students and getting to see everyone grow more confident in their voices as the weeks went on. Ben created such an encouraging atmosphere that made the class a joy to be part of. Definitely recommend even if you haven't had any singing experience in the past and just want to learn!", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Benjamin is an amazing instructor!  In very little time he will teach you how to sing well!  The course teaches the classical technique, which focuses on breath support.  You will learn how to use deep breathing to support your voice without straining your vocal cords.", "[0.65] [Winter 2022] Take this class if you want to learn how to sing! Really enjoyed it", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Benjamin Liupaogo is a fantastic instructor. I highly recommend this class, especially those who have little experience singing or like to sing, but are uncomfortable doing so. Liupaogo creates a comfortable space and is shockingly effective in his coaching within the little time he is given. A truly phanominal class...", "[0.5] [Winter 2022] The course teaches basic singing techniques quite clearly, but it was only a 10-minute-long 1-on-1 meeting per week for each student due to COVID-19, and this included a few minutes of warmups each time, so while I did receive some feedback for the song I chose, it always felt too short to learn very much.", "[0.5] [Winter 2022] Fun for a former high school choral singer to brush up on singing fundamentals. You have private 10-minute voice coaching every week, rather than a group session, so I spent the majority of the quarter learning one song and working on breathing technique.", "[0.25] [Winter 2022] This is a great introductory course to Voice. It was a lot of fun without any sort of pressure. Benjamin gives very concrete feedback on technique and works individually with each student (there are no group practices except for the first few class sessions). I felt like my singing improved drastically throughout the quarter (note: not a singer, pretty bad at it, but I had some formal music lessons).", "[0.6] [Winter 2022] amazing class", "[0.4] [Winter 2022] the class only grants you around 10 minutes of individual sessions each week. i would take this class for the convenience, but if you wanted to be more serious about taking voice classes, i'd recommend going elsewhere.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] take it, it's a great class for people interested in improving their fundamentals in voice. the instructor is great and super understanding as well as encouraging", "[0.55] [Spring 2022] Great way to learn the basics of singing! Even if you have no experience, take it!", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] The format when I took it was 10m per week per student 1:1. Because of COVID isolation and post-isolation symptoms I missed 3 sessions, Ben cancelled another due to personal reason, week 1 was just intro and syllabus, week 10 was just the final performance, so altogether I had maybe 4 weeks of actual instruction. I understand it might help students to have some privacy, but it's also really inefficient to spend almost half the 10m on warmup exercises that could be done as a group, I never feel like I get anywhere far in 10m. Like maybe alternate one week 1:1 and one week altogether? Or 20m every 2 weeks? Class logistics aside, Ben is an amazingly supportive and knowledgeable instructor, and I did feel like I gained a few insights into what I need to work on in my voice.", "[1.0] [Spring 2022] If you enjoy singing and/or want to improve your singing skills (regardless of where you're at in your singing journey or how much prior singing experience you have), I would highly recommend this course! I came into this course with not a lot of singing experience and I really enjoyed my time taking it and felt like I improved a lot over the course of the quarter. Ben is an awesome singing instructor. I felt super comfortable singing around him, he is very encouraging and supportive with his feedback and also with the way he holds himself during lessons. You get one-on-one time with Ben every week, so his feedback is tailored to you, which is super helpful. He is patient when you need a few tries to put his feedback into practice and it really does feel like he cares for you and wants to help you improve. I'm so glad I took this course!", "[0.65] [Spring 2022] Take it if you need half of your CE? It was literally 6 minutes a week, but it is just you and the professor. Would not say I learned a ton, but it was fun enough", "[0.2] [Spring 2022] Learnt a lot, even though I had no singing experience. You have to be willing to put in time outside of class to practice to truly learn from this course though, since lessons are only 10 minutes per person.", "[0.85] [Spring 2022] Mr. Liupaogo is a fantastic vocal coach. He gives effective instruction, is constantly supportive, and assures that the class does not subject upon his students any stress at all. If you have any interest in singing, I cannot recommend taking a class from Benjamin highly enough.", "[0.75] [Spring 2022] If you're someone who has no knowledge of singing technique/never taken singing classes of any kind and you're interested in learning about singing, take this class! Ben is an incredibly caring and knowledgable professor, and the class itself is very low stress and enjoyable. Although the sessions themselves are very short (10 minutes 1:1 per week), you will learn a lot.", "[0.75] [Spring 2022] Great class! Make sure you practice on your own though", "[0.0] [Spring 2022] Take it!", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] Take it!! It was easily the highlight of my week. A low stakes, lovely environment to explore your voice in a structured way", "[0.75] [Autumn 2021] It's a good class to take if you'd like to get into the habit of singing as well as learn the proper techniques", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Great introduction to voice. Focus on posture, breathing, and producing a clear strong sound", "[-0.2] [Autumn 2021] really good course, but time is very limited in a group setting. I'm not sure it is worth the $250.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] I learned a lot in the class and Prof. Liupaogo was very helpful in helping us learn technique and proper support. However, the individual 5-10 minute format that was used for this quarter I felt was not conducive to learning and I had to practice a lot outside of the course. Also note that there is an associated course fee for $250, which might be a barrier for some students.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Benjamin is awesome! There's no pressure, but I learned a ton about my voice and how to actually use it. Definitely an awesome class that I highly recommend.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2021] N/A", "[0.5] [Autumn 2021] It's good if you want to learn how to sing", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Take it! Ben is a fantastic teacher, but also an amazing person - I'd have long sessions with Ben that involved singing, talking, and just in general each session is a great, mood-lifting time. I can't recommend this enough.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2021] good intro to singing if you haven't sang before", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] Ben is really nice and helps ease you into the process.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] Take it! It's a great, easy introduction into learning how to sing.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] Would highly recommend. Ben is such a supportive and encouraging teacher!", "[-0.1] [Autumn 2021] Make sure to practice every week and utilize the Braun practice rooms. If anything feels uncomfortable while singing be sure to ask how to adjust your body to prevent that. Unfortunately group lessons don't allow for extensive one on one time with an instructor, but I still felt that they were tailored to my voice and needs.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Very little work and lots of fun even for a total beginner! Benjamin is a very kind, encouraging instructor. I would really recommend this class if you are thinking about it!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] This is a good class for people who want to improve their singing but aren't ready to commit (for time/stress/monetary reasons) to private lessons. You will get about 10-15 minutes a week privately and another 5-10 minutes all together doing warmups, so it isn't a lot of time, but it's a good way to keep you practicing and the instruction is still quite valuable. For a beginner and an amateur like me, it was the right thing.", "[0.8] [Spring 2021] Definitely go for it! I think this class is best when you haven't had much experience singing.", "[0.15] [Spring 2021] Think about songs you want to sing in advance! Practice more.", "[0.65] [Spring 2021] Good introduction to the fundamentals of voice and getting some feedback and performance opportunities. You really get out what you put into it; practice daily and don't be afraid to volunteer to sing in the class to get more feedback.", "[1.0] [Spring 2021] Super fun class! Very friendly to beginners and everyone is always super supportive. Nova is so sweet / understanding and an incredible instructor, she gives very helpful unique advice to each person and is invested in everyone's experience. You will improve more if you practice more!", "[1.0] [Winter 2021] Love this class ! Greg was so helpful in helping us get better with singing and was so kind. I honestly felt like my voice has improved after this class and I\u2019m really happy about that !", "[0.0] [Winter 2021] take it.", "[0.85] [Winter 2021] Greg is a fantastic instructor, and I learned a lot from him! I would highly recommend this class for improving your vocal skills.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2020] Great intro about the human voice and how singing works.", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] If you are interested in singing, take this class! Kathryne is wonderful and she will make anyone a better singer, wherever they start from. It's also pretty riskless, the groups are small, so don't worry about what others will think.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2019] Its fairly laid back but gives you the basic tools you need to get started on singing.", "[-0.45] [Autumn 2019] Kathryne is a great teacher! I think the only problem with this class is that she only has 50ish minutes for 6 people so getting one on one attention can be difficult. That being said, she is very personal with her teaching style and knows how to pinpoint exactly your biggest weaknesses as a singer.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2019] Katherine is a thoughtful and sharp diagnoser. I have witnessed my classmates transform into more powerful performers in a short span of time", "[0.75] [Autumn 2019] come take this class. Kathryne is very nice and welcoming.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Very effective teaching, fun community. Take it to improve technique and feel happier when you sing!", "[0.5] [Spring 2019] If you want to improve your singing, this is where you start", "[0.85] [Spring 2019] Great teaching, great course with many different veins contributing to  the teaching and content.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] This class is super beginner friendly and everyone in it is very non-judgemental and creates a comfortable environment to sing in, which I know is the concern of some people. Definitely take it if you're at all interested in becoming a better singer in any shape way or form. Claire is a wonderful instructor who gives personalized advice to each student.", "[0.35] [Spring 2019] Claire really really cares about you and wants you to improve. The class is only 6 students so you get a lot of attention on how to improve your singing. So sad to see her retire :(", "[0.45] [Spring 2019] Highly recommend!", "[0.1] [Spring 2019] Take this class! I used ti sing so much during high school and this class gave me a low-key way to continue it. It also exposed me to other lower commitment ways to continue singing next year other than acapella.", "[0.75] [Spring 2019] Take it! It's fun and you do learn how to be a better singer.", "[0.8] [Spring 2019] This is definitely worth taking; it helps with anxiety over singing quite well.", "[0.9] [Spring 2019] Take it! So much fun. Highlight of my days. Claire is a wonderful teacher.", "[0.0] [Spring 2019] Take it even if you don&#x2019;t have any experience. You do sing in front of the class, but it&#x2019;s not as nerve racking as you would think at first", "[0.55] [Spring 2019] This was an excellent, low stress class where no one was judgmental and all wanted to help each other succeed. You get as much out of it as you put in.", "[0.6] [Spring 2019] Great class", "[0.65] [Spring 2019] very good course, take it just for a chance to sing each week", "[0.65] [Spring 2019] Fun and supportive environment for dipping your toe into singing and performing.", "[0.2] [Spring 2019] Claire is leaving sadly but do it. You get so much confidence singing in front of people even if youre not actually that good", "[0.9] [Spring 2019] Take it! Claire is a vocal magician and will tell you to do weird things that magically make your singing like so much better. She's really good at working with people of any vocal experience and skills, so don't worry about whether or not you think you can sing.", "[0.55] [Spring 2019] fun class!", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] Do it. Claire is awesome, and you'll learn a lot about singing. It's a good class for personal growth lol", "[-0.3] [Winter 2019] If you are unsure whether or not you want to get into singing, give this course a try.", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] This class is fantastic! Claire is an actual wizard - someone will be struggling to hit a note and she'll say \"okay, now sing it on one leg\" and all of a sudden they'll hit it perfectly. It's magic.", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] Claire is an extremely dedicated instructor and had really helpful and personalized suggestions for each student. The class environment is super supportive and you really learn a lot about the technique behind singing.", "[0.0] [Winter 2019] Beware that it's a group class, so you only get a little time in class to actually sing.", "[0.7] [Winter 2019] If you want to get practice and instruction for singing, this class is a great place to start!", "[0.45] [Winter 2019] practicing on your own time really helps with getting the most out of the class", "[0.6] [Winter 2019] Claire is unbelievably kind and extremely knowledgable regarding the voice--awesome class to take!", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] Definitely take this course if you want to  improve your singing. Claire is an approachable, warm teacher who helps you play to your strengths and develop the skills necessary to accomplish your particular singing goals.", "[0.6] [Winter 2019] This is a great class to build the foundations of singing.", "[0.6] [Winter 2019] Great for dusting off your voice or coming in as a complete beginner.", "[1.0] [Winter 2019] This course was a lot of fun and I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I'm not sure how much it has improved my singing. It was nice to have guidance and structure for practicing singing, but a lot of what we did felt like stuff someone could do on their own. Additionally, with the way the class is structured, each student does not get that much individual attention. If money is an issue, there are probably better alternatives to this class. However, if you just like singing and would like a supportive, fun environment to practice in--sign up!", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] A great way to gain some insight into singing and start to develop your own voice. You get to pick your own song, which makes the class all the more enjoyable.", "[0.45] [Winter 2019] Not a bad idea", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] Claire is lovely! I would say I improved, if only marginally, which is probably due to class being only 50 minutes a week. Something about the class time and possible improvement and the hefty $250 (up from $200 I believe) fee doesn't match up, but this is a good course if you're willing to overlook that. Do practice outside of class! I sure did not do that enough. It's also a great way to step out of your comfort zone and do something you may not be great at in front of a bunch of people, so if that's something that appeals to you (as it should) this is a good course for that as well.", "[0.55] [Winter 2019] It's helpful if you can read music, but definitely possible even if you can't. Claire is super supportive so reach out to her if you need some extra practice.", "[0.5] [Winter 2019] Take it! If you put effort outside of class to do vocal exercises, you'll improve your singing.", "[0.0] [Winter 2019] Do it!", "[0.5] [Winter 2019] very good", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] Claire is great! She can work with anyone. I came into the course without any vocal fundamentals (along with several others in my class) and the exercises she showed us and feedback she gave us really has made a difference. I feel much more confident even just singing along to songs with friends and have gotten a couple of compliments that I can carry a tune now", "[0.5] [Winter 2019] Take it, it's a lot of fun.", "[0.55] [Winter 2019] Very fun, do consider taking this", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] Great beginning class! Make sure to practice outside of class if you really want to develop the skills taught.", "[0.0] [Winter 2019] Take it!", "[0.0] [Winter 2019] take it, especially if you haven't done any singing before because then you'll get more out of it.", "[0.7] [Winter 2019] This class is a great way to learn the basics for anyone who wants to learn how to sing. You absolutely don't need to have any musical knowledge to take this class - I sure didn't. About 6-8 minutes per day are allocated for 1:1 feedback per student, and the rest is vocal warmup. You may be better off hiring a vocal coach, given the price of this course and the amount of attention you get, if you really want to just learn to sing, but Claire is a phenomenal teacher and there's something to be said for learning how to sing alongside other students.", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] Claire is incredible! Definitely recommend this class, even if you're like me and don't like your singing voice. It was crazy to see everyone's improvement over the course of the quarter.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2018] You get out based on how much you put what you learned in class into practice on your own.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] Claire is great at engaging students and provides a comfortable, low-pressure atmosphere to learn to sing!", "[0.6] [Autumn 2018] Very fun class!", "[0.7] [Autumn 2018] It is a group class so know what you're going into. You'll only get personal attention for like ~10 mins and then Claire has to move on to other people bc of time constraints. It's a fun class but if you really want to learn how to sing private lessons are recommended", "[0.6] [Autumn 2018] Very chill. just sing two songs per quarter and practice technique in class. Learn good warm up exercises", "[0.6] [Autumn 2018] Great introductory voice class.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2018] Have fun with it!", "[-0.4] [Autumn 2018] Claire is an awesome teacher.  Fun and low pressure environment, but you will learn to get over your fear of singing in front of others.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] Super fun, Claire is great.  Really welcoming environment.  Looked forward to going every week.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] Excellent class to take, even if you sing badly (I did). Class teaches you proper breathing and vocal techniques, but more importantly builds up your confidence and Claire is extremely encouraging and provides a safe environment to learn how to sing better", "[0.4] [Autumn 2018] A lot of growth comes from your own investment. Ask questions and use the practice rooms.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] I do think it would be a hard class to take if you have zero experience with reading music, but otherwise, it's a great and fairly simple way to learn how to sing and get the chance to practice and perform in a low-pressure enviornment", "[0.9] [Spring 2018] Good course if you have absolutely no voice guidance. Claire is sometimes hard to follow when she is teaching, but the overall outcome was a better ability to sing for sure!", "[0.1] [Spring 2018] While I'm not so sure about the price, it is a good way to get some practice.", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] Take it if you want to learn to sing!  It's a great introduction to it.  You will make progress and significantly improve especially if you haven't sung before.  Also very comfortable environment to start in, Claire does a great job with helping you improve no matter your skill level with no judgement at all.", "[0.75] [Spring 2018] It's a fun class and if you're self conscious, it's good since they are very small class sizes.", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] take the course! beware -- it fills up quick so make sure to register as soon as the thing goes live. you learn how to actually sing. she teaches you how to breathe, support your voice, warmup, and gives you good advice on technique and more. you get to perform two pieces in the end, which is really cool :)", "[0.3] [Spring 2018] Make sure you practice outside of class, it's the only way to actually absorb and master what you learned in class.", "[0.55] [Spring 2018] This course gives you the opportunity to learn more about your voice, mostly in terms of singing but also to some extent speaking as well. There are two solo pieces that you'll perform in the class, one selected from a small packet of options and one of your choosing.", "[0.8] [Spring 2018] Take it if you want to learn to sing! Claire is incredibly kind and non-judgmental, and makes class a really safe space.", "[0.85] [Spring 2018] Good way to improve singing confidence!

Definitely take it. Claire is amazing and teaches you a lot!", "[0.9] [Winter 2018] Great class for intro singers! Gets you comfortable with your voice and a great intro to different techniques", "[0.85] [Winter 2018] Amazing class! Really take advantage of practice rooms and Claire's office hours. Don't be afraid - or rather be excited at the idea of being able to sing any song of your choice.", "[0.85] [Winter 2018] This course is an amazing introduction to singing for someone who has had absolutely no previous experience. Claire is extremely nice and flexible and will accommodate everyone with a lot of help.", "[0.4] [Winter 2018] Interesting to try.", "[0.8] [Winter 2018] Amazing class! I had a lot of fun", "[0.6] [Winter 2018] It's a good chance to try something different.", "[0.0] [Winter 2018] Practice as much as time permits outside of class and use practice rooms whenever possible", "[0.9] [Winter 2018] Claire is a wonderful and caring teacher who will make singing fun for you.", "[0.95] [Winter 2018] It is a very good opportunity to practice your singing. Claire Giovannetti is a great instructor and is always willing to help you. Do not expect, however, to learn a great deal; while the instruction is fantastic, you meet only once per week, just for 50 minutes. If you're an absolute beginner, you can definitely take it. The vast majority of people I've met had none signing experience and wanted to learn to sound more smooth.", "[0.9] [Winter 2018] Take it! It was very helpful for improving my singing and speaking voice. It was also a ton of fun!", "[0.95] [Winter 2018] The professor is so nice and encouraging, which is super important for a class where most people have never sung in public before (me included). She emphasizes techniques you can practice on your own to improve, and doesn't put pressure on you to perform perfectly, just to learn.", "[0.0] [Winter 2018] Take it if you have a bit of singing background", "[0.75] [Winter 2018] Claire is such a nice instructor. She will help you with getting better no matter what your level is. The only downside is that you don't get much individual time in class.", "[0.45] [Winter 2018] Good introduction", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] It's a very fun class and great way to try something new and get out of your comfort zone at Stanford", "[0.4] [Autumn 2017] It's a great course to introduce voice concepts. People come in with a range of experience but everyone is supportive so it's not uncomfortable doing solos. I came in with no vocal experience so I was nervous about that initially.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2017] Claire is a fantastic instructor who is able to work with students on all levels-- would highly recommend this class", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] I find the class dynamic of this course very encouraging. I think it is a good beginners class for anyone interested in singing.", "[0.5] [Autumn 2017] It's worth taking. You won't sound amazing by the end of it, but it is a good foundation for future instruction.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2017] Take it! Practice outside of class to get the most out of it", "[0.0] [Autumn 2017] Practice outside of class", "[0.5] [Autumn 2017] Practice outside of class a lot! You find yourself improving a lot more than you think", "[0.75] [Autumn 2017] Great class for those who don't know how to sing. You learn a lot about the basics of singing, such as how to breathe correctly and produce a consistent sound, as well as a variety of vocal exercises.", "[0.25] [Autumn 2017] Take it, it is a stress reliever regardless of singing ability", "[0.0] [Autumn 2017] Use the practice rooms and learn how to read music", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] Take it! The teacher is so encouraging for new singers and gives us specific feedback for how to go forward from where we're at. She makes the class environment really fun and not scary.", "[0.9] [Spring 2017] Very fun and engaging class, especially if you love to sing.", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] It's a fun class, and if you have any sort of interest in singing it's a great way to start. Everyone is very non-judgmental and it's very low commitment. I'm really glad I did it.", "[0.8] [Spring 2017] The best thing is you can choose and work on your favorite song.", "[0.4] [Spring 2017] I recommend it, but I also am concerned about not receiving enough individual attention. You will get to practice with the instructor for a small portion of the class, but if you pay attention while others are practicing, you can learn from their adjustments as well.", "[0.7] [Spring 2017] TAKE IT! No matter where you are, it will improve your singing. This comes from both my personal experience and also seeing others improve over the course.", "[0.9] [Spring 2017] That it's awesome and Claire is great and don't be afraid to sing strong and smooth!", "[0.75] [Spring 2017] Nice class for fun!", "[0.55] [Spring 2017] It really is not worth the $200. There are 7 students so you get like 5 minutes of help, in which you sing your song and she gives you another exercise that she already gave you a few weeks ago. Only take it if you can get it subsidized.", "[0.8] [Spring 2017] One on one time with Claire was useful although usually brief. Because of that, she often gave similar suggestions week to week. I do feel like I improved and know how to go about practicing in the future.", "[-0.55] [Spring 2017] The classes are large, about 8-10-ish. You get basically 4 minutes to sing per class, and Claire, who is sweet and supportive, errs strongly on the side of affirmation as opposed to telling you exactly how bad you sound and why. She talks very fast and I never didn't feel flustered. I was immensely frustrated and felt condescended to, though I was actually very invested in improving. Also, choose your song early on and decide whether or not to stick with it early on. I had an okay time, but it's probably not worth the fee if you're not a music major, unfortunately.", "[0.85] [Spring 2017] It is enjoyable and fun, and you do learn a bit, but if your primary goal is to get better at singing it's probably worth taking individual lessons (although I haven't taken them so I can't be sure). Since classes are 7 people, and since you are being taught to sing solo (you prepare and perform a couple songs for the class over the course of the quarter), you only get around 5 min individual attention each class after the warm up exercises.", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] Claire is a great teacher who gives fair time to everyone. If you are uncomfortable with your voice (like I was), you'll find that the environment in the class is really welcoming and you'll be able to sing in front of everyone eventually! It's a great intro class to singing and a lot of fun.", "[0.8] [Spring 2017] Unlike Music 12A, this class is much less work and just as or perhaps more fun.

Since there are 6 students in the class, there isn't enough time for each person to get significant instruction. You do pick up good nuggets here and there, but I don't think it was done in the most efficient way possible. I was also hoping to delve deeper into specific vocal techniques (e.g. neutral larynx, working in mix, singing in higher registers), but we barely scratched the surface, which is fair as this is a beginner class.

Just a few readings each week with some fun required music to listen to.

Dr. Schultz is a great lecturer; she turns facts into marvelous stories, which makes the material super engaging.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2017] This class was great! They teach you everything they expect you to know about music, so no experience is necessary. One of the coolest parts was how many guest lecturers/musicians we had.

I recommend doing the readings, they add a lot to the class and they're really useful to know for the exams.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2017] It's useful to fulfill WAYS/GERs, but the lectures are pretty long and the slides aren't too helpful to study from. There are also exams and two short papers. You learn about some cool musical cultures, but most of the class time is spent hearing people's opinions on pieces, which to a non-humanities student will seem tedious and pointless.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2016] If you are not just taking this class for Ways requirement, participate in this class more.

The material is super interesting.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2016] Solid course for satisfying ED, though a little too fuzzy for my taste. There were times when the discussions just felt like high school English, which I can't say I enjoyed.  On the other hand, there were some cool random things I learned about music around the world. So, all in all, did not enjoy discussions, but enjoyed the actual material.  Class is three 2-3 page papers (pretty easy).

He knows a great deal about anything piano/keyboard so I always feel like I'm learning so much from each class.

Murray gives out very comprehensive handouts and worksheets that will give you material to help you practice.

Do try to put in the effort to practice on your own time though b/c 1 hour per week won't get you anywhere soon. Class fee is high - $200 - (unless you're a music major) and it's a struggle to get fee waiver/reimbursements. Almost impossible b/c I think they're chaing the rules or something. Therefore, if you're taking this class partly out of interest and don't care if you're gonna get credit for it or not, you can always ask the teacher if you can show up and not officially enroll.", "[0.7] [Winter 2017] Although it says it goes from 7-10 PM, the class is actually broken up into 3 one-hour sessions, and depending on your experience, you pick one.  Daisy is an awesome teacher, and very passionate.", "[0.9] [Winter 2017] I would say be sure to actually practice so you can learn how to play and keep up.

Ben is a master truly and has changed my voice and my life - I mean it.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] Take it if you can! The class is a bang for your buck. Benjamin is the best, he really tries the MOST methods to help you improve as a singer to see what clicks.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2022] Overall, good!  Class has a heavy emphasis on performance over technique, though, so be aware - you will have to do a lot of that work on your own time.  However, Benjamin was definitely very knowledgable and supportive in getting you where you need to be.  He might seem a bit intimidating at first, but he really just wants you to succeed.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] Benjamin Liupaogo is an incredible, one-of-a-kind instructor. You will learn so much and so quickly from him! This course fits the scope of learning and performing two songs perfectly. You will have such a fun time taking this class while growing so much.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] Ben is one of the best vocal instructors I've had the honor of encountering. Even with only 15 minutes a week, I felt my technique and vocal performance improve. He helped me get out of my own way with transparency and kind bluntness.", "[0.45] [Winter 2022] You get as much as you put into it. Trying to cram this course in on top of other things is doable, but you won't get the most out of it. A heavy emphasis on performance readiness.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Ben is a wonderful teacher and cares about helping his students improve from whatever starting point they are at. He also fosters a safe space for students to really act and emote. If you are lucky enough to take this class and also have Amy as your accompanist, you will definitely enjoy it.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] If you have the available resources to take this class, please do! You improve so much a singer. Benjamin will definitely guide you and is a great vocal coach; however, a lot of your success is dependent on you and your willingness to put time in. The class each week is only an hour long, and if there are 4 people in your class, you only have about (but most oftentimes, less than) 15 minutes to work with Benjamin and the piano accompanist. So it is crucial that you put in time outside of class.", "[0.0] [Winter 2022] Do it!", "[0.45] [Spring 2022] I felt like I learned something from this course but I did not enjoy Benjamin as a teacher. He's rather rude and dismissive, and it didn't really seem like he was invested in helping his students do well. There were many times when it was clear that a student wasn't understanding what Benjamin was asking them to do, and then Benjamin basically just told them to practice more instead of actually telling them how to improve their technique.", "[0.75] [Spring 2022] Ben is an incredible teacher. He has completely changed who I am as a singer and I am so grateful to have worked with him. This class is great for people who love to sing and want to perform. No need to know technique or read music, but be willing to give the class your all. The more you put in, the more you get out.", "[0.85] [Spring 2022] A strong focus on being performance ready rather than working technique every class. You get what you put into it, so be sure you have time to practice. Very good for working on stage fright.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2021] I would recommend this course for anyone looking to practice singing in front of others, and to gain light coaching on a couple pieces.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2021] If you want to learn how to sing or improve your singing, take this course!", "[0.15] [Autumn 2021] Very laid back and chill. You can choose your own songs or get suggestions. Working with other people is a great way to realize that everyone has a very unique voice with its own beauty and struggles. Attendance wasn't super high and we would often end with extra time which was slightly frustrating because would have wanted to learn more during that time instead of calling it a day.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Ben is an amazing teacher and truly cares about all his students. I would definitely take this class if you love to sing and just want more opportunities to perform and get better.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Definitely take this course! Professor Luipaogo is an incredible teacher. He helped me tackle two pretty challenging songs, and I feel like I am a better singer after this course.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2020] I really enjoyed working with Kathryne Jennings and would recommend taking a voice class with her.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2020] Take it! Kathyne is a wizard.", "[0.8] [Spring 2020] Kathryne is an incredible voice teacher! It's amazing to feel yourself improving as the quarter goes on.", "[1.0] [Spring 2020] TAKE THIS!

It was such a joy to take,", "[0.8] [Spring 2020] Kathryne is a wonderful voice teacher and I highly encourage you to learn from her!", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] I love taking lessons from Kathryne. She really cares about her students, and I am always astounded by the improvement of my voice from the beginning of the quarter to the end.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2019] Even though the class meets so infrequently I still learned a lot form the course. It also provided a safe space to practice singing in front of other individuals on a consistent basis.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2019] This is a fabulous alternative to private voice lessons. Kathryne is incredible", "[0.4] [Autumn 2019] Take this course! I feel like I really grew as a singer and performer from Kathryne's instruction.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2019] The class barely gives enough time to get any kind of feedback from the instructor. 50 minutes of class time four students, including transitioning time, warm-ups, announcements, etc, is an egregiously short amount of time. It is enraging that Stanford charges $250 for this class when you get, if you're lucky, maybe 10 minutes of individualized instruction (sometimes you do not get to sing at all). The class should be held for longer if you want any student to feel the course is worth its money. I know that Friends of Music offers scholarships, but attaching a price tag to the course is a signification that the class is, in itself, of that value, when it is clearly not the case. It is irresponsible of the music department/Stanford to create a class that charges students for so little instruction, in a subject matter where individualized interaction is perhaps the most important element. Yes, voice lessons is that solution, but it is a cutthroat, inaccessible, and clandestine admission process who accepts students who likely have had the resources and privileges to have studied voice before. The inconsideration of low-income, less-privileged students who are passionate or even slightly interested in voice is really astounding.", "[0.35] [Autumn 2019] If you get in, take it. Kathryne is a wonderful instructor and with just a very limited amount of time, she can change how you perceive and access your own voice completely.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] Very chill class, but you get out of it what you put in. Try to consistently practice and develop good vocal habits. Would highly recommend. Claire is a wonderful person and great voice instructor.", "[0.8] [Spring 2019] Claire is fantastic- unfortunately she&#x2019;ll be retiring, but this class was awesome. I learned so much about singing this quarter.", "[0.8] [Spring 2019] This is a great class if you like singing and is low time commitment.", "[0.9] [Spring 2019] This class is the catch-all between beginning voice and private lessons, so how much you get out of it depends on outside self-study. You get 15 minutes as a group to warm up, then 10 minutes for individual work & feedback - on its own, it's not really enough to improve too much. There's a lot of freedom in the class regarding repertoire - from some jazzy pop to opera arias, you can pick your own piece if you like, or Claire can give some suggestions as well.", "[0.6] [Spring 2019] This is a very good voice class. The class time is too short, but Claire manages to use it well.", "[0.8] [Spring 2019] Claire is so good! I wish she wasn't retiring.", "[0.75] [Spring 2019] I highly recommend the intermediate singing classes! You get to learn from both the instructor and the other students, and it's a lot of fun!", "[-0.1] [Winter 2019] It's small and much better than the lower level classes. Claire is forgetful, though, so remind her what you need or you may never get it.", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] Great way to improve your singing skills!", "[0.85] [Winter 2019] It's amazing! Claire is so nice and really teaches to the level of everyone in the room.", "[0.55] [Winter 2019] This is an excellent course. It's biggest flaw is its brevity. You will learn a ton.", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] Definitely recommend! Claire is a great teacher, and you'll definitely see your singing improve over the course of the quarter!", "[0.6] [Winter 2019] You get out of voice lessons what you put in. It is important to practice throughout the week to really solidify and improve on what you learn in class.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] Claire is amazing. She is always able to give feedback that allows you to get better, and she is so friendly and encouraging. It's also amazing to get to work with an accompanist each week to really drill the song you are working on.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] A great class for someone who wants to improve their singing technique without trying for solo lessons. Very fun and Claire is very supportive and helpful!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] It is awesome! Claire is lovely, and a four-person class is close enough to a private lesson in terms of focus on your personal issues with technique and performance to totally be worth it.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] It is a great class for those who have great passion for singing!", "[0.7] [Autumn 2018] This is a fun class, but the art of voice takes practice. You're not going to drastically improve over the quarter, especially if you're at this stage in your vocal training. I'd say most of the people in my class sang marginally after the quarter was over.", "[0.8] [Spring 2018] Great class :)", "[0.9] [Spring 2018] Great class! Claire is good at providing instruction that applies to multiple people. Really good way to get singing experience", "[0.45] [Spring 2018] Having some prior vocal training would be good, self-driven course and most of work is outside of class", "[0.6] [Spring 2018] It's a good place to practice singing! If you want rigorous help, it may not be the course for you, though.", "[0.85] [Spring 2018] Wonderful course. Claire is a spectacular teacher and it is wonderful to learn with and from fellow singers!", "[0.1] [Winter 2018] If you want an hour to practice singing take this class", "[0.7] [Winter 2018] It's a good way to keep singing and get some help.", "[0.85] [Winter 2018] It is a great class for those familiar with singing who want to expand their abilities and repertoire!", "[0.9] [Winter 2018] Wonderful class! I love the group class dynamic since it allows you to learn from the work of your peers!", "[0.4] [Autumn 2017] This course is a helpful way to maintain vocal practice.", "[-0.15] [Autumn 2017] Great class, but you don't get much private instruction unfortunately. Really is how much you put in.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2017] All the beginning and intermediate singing classes are great, and this is no exception! Great one-on-one help from Claire and practice working with an accompanist make this class particularly great.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] It's a very self directed course. Take the time to find the right songs for you and be confident in the choices you make. Claire will guide and improve your voice no matter what, so make sure the songs you choose challenge your voice and help it grow.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2017] Great class! I love the collaborative energy and support of the group class atmosphere!", "[0.65] [Spring 2017] It is a good course for being introduced to voice lessons if you already have singing ability. However, since there are four students and this class only meets 50 minutes a week, don't expect this class to substitute a one on one voice lesson.", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] Take it! Claire is awesome, it encourages diversity and flexibility between genres with the different songs you sing, and is still fun and helps you grow as a singer. You sing four different songs generally of your choice.", "[0.8] [Spring 2017] All of Claire's singing classes are excellent! They are a great way to get into singing without having to audition or know anything, and 73 is no exception!", "[0.0] [Spring 2017] Do it!", "[0.8] [Winter 2017] This is a great course if you want to build up your repertoire and get some vocal coaching along the way; if you want to just study technique, you'd be better off taking private lessons (not necessarily at Stanford)", "[0.5] [Winter 2017] Its fun", "[0.0] [Winter 2017] Have some songs in mind ahead of time", "[0.65] [Winter 2017] Great class to learn new repertoire!", "[0.9] [Winter 2017] Great course for improving vocal ability.  Lots of room to do what you like!", "[0.7] [Winter 2017] This course is quite fun, you have the opportunity to develop much more self-awareness about your voice, but it is most worth it when you put in the time to practice outside of class.", "[0.05] [Autumn 2016] If you're looking to get practice singing in front of others, learn more about working with an accompanist, and learn more about how voice teaching works, then this is a good option. I don't think I improved that much technique-wise (there's only so much time for each student), but I learned a lot from watching Claire teach me and the others in my class.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2016] This is a good class to just keep your voice in shape and work on specific pieces a little bit. It is laid back and is great if you have specific pieces you would like to work on.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2016] A great way to improve vocal ability, expand repertoire, and get performance feedback!", "[0.4] [Autumn 2016] There are typically 4 students in each class. We do warmups together for about 20 minutes, in which we also try exercises for various techniques (which we repeat back to her one by one). Two people go out with an accompanist to work on their piece, while two stay with Claire. At the end, the two who left perform their pieces for the class. The class is a low-commitment way of improving technique, but you get out of it what you put into it. You will only get one-on-one instruction for about 10 minutes every other week, so practice and make the most of it!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2016] Claire's an awesome teacher! Have fun with the repertoire that you choose", "[0.7] [Autumn 2016] I feel like the content taught here is pretty much similar to 65b or even 65a. So in the end it all comes down to how u apply the stuff u learnt outside of the classroom.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2016] Music 73 is a great class if you want to get extra vocal practice and guidance on technique and song choice. You get to sing a lot and there are plenty of opportunities to get feedback."], "MUSIC 73Z": ["[0.85] [Spring 2019] It is a fabulous class to learn about your voice in an extremely accommodating and supportive environment.

Claire is an amazing instructor and she is also very nice. I would recommend looking through pieces that you'd like to sing beforehand so you don't waste time searching for songs throughout the quarter.", "[1.0] [Winter 2018] This class was an absolute joy to take. The format is a lot of fun: you work in a small group of around 4, warming up together, practicing technique, and performing for each other. It's a great way to get to know some other people who are interested in singing, and also to get more practice performing in front of others. Claire does a great job of fostering this community and giving high quality feedback to help us improve our singing. Taking voice classes has not only helped me sing better, but it has improved my overall confidence in other situations too, like public speaking.", "[0.85] [Winter 2018] Claire is very kind and expertly gives helpful feedback that makes me a better voice student.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] Claire is a great instructor. She cares about each student's learning and knows how to improve each student's vocal ability", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] 73 is an amazing opportunity to work in a smaller group and have way more focused work and attention from the instructor and the accompanist that plays the piano for us weekly. The course is just awesome. I highly recommend it"], "MUSIC 74C": ["[1.0] [Autumn 2022] TAKE IT! It's a fun class. Charles does go on tangents sometimes, but he's honestly pretty entertaining, and when he plays, he's mesmerizing. I liked the course even just going to the classes because every time, I'd leave inspired and encouraged to practice and play beautiful music.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2022] It helps a lot to have played other instruments to make sense of the fast teaching pace in the course, but you can really get a ton out of it in a short amount of time.  I'd highly recommend!", "[0.5] [Autumn 2022] The instructor spent a lot more time just talking and telling stories than teaching.  In fact, my friend dis-enrolled because she wasn't learning anything and it seems the course is more of a social music time for the instructor than it is time to learn", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] there isn't a TON of guitar playing in class, but if you're looking for something to hold you accountable to practice guitar more, this is a great opportunity for that", "[0.6] [Winter 2022] Professor Ferguson is a passionate guitar player, but he is not as patient as he should be with guitar beginners. I was always scared whenever he would walk around and ask us to play something that he just taught us 3 minutes ago because he would not leave you until you played it decently.", "[0.7] [Winter 2022] If you have any experience in playing the fork guitar or electric guitar, I do not think catching up with this class would not be so hard. However, if you are a pure beginner at playing the guitar, I guess it will be challenging (at least when playing barre chords like F).", "[1.0] [Winter 2022] This is a very fun class, which I stressed too much about. Just enjoy playing the guitar, make a little time to practice, and don't stress yourself out if you aren't where you want to be! Charles does a great job of working with you from whatever level you are at. The class will have a mix of people who are further along and just starting out, so don't worry about how you compare, just enjoy your own learning journey. Your pop song is for your own learning, you don't have to do some big performance on it at the end of the class, so don't over stress that if you are someone who does not like recitals. Overall, a very fun class which would always go by quickly with Charles' funny stories and beautiful playing that we got to listen to. I just wish I had stressed less about it!", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] If you're trying to fulfill a WAYS-CE requirement this class might be a good fit, but you probably won't learn to play that much guitar from this class. Prof. Ferguson is a very talented musician but not a good teacher. He would jump around between completely random, unconnected skills during each class that had nothing to do with the songs that we were supposed to be learning. Each class was more of a garbled stream of consciousness than a deliberate curriculum that taught us to master certain basic skills. Prof. Ferguson spent more time telling us random stories from his life than teaching us to play guitar.", "[0.45] [Winter 2022] Its a good time.", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] Pretty fast-paced class. Charles is a hilarious prof and made classes fun to go to. It's also incredible watching him play all these intricate songs", "[0.0] [Spring 2022] Class itself only gives you the basic framework and requires a lot of self-practice at home.", "[-0.6] [Spring 2022] Charles is a little rude and scary. We didn't play much in class, mostly listen to him play. Some interesting music theory, but overall I really didn't like this class.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] Moves really fast if you have never played an instrument/touched the musical field before. For those who have but are just learning to play guitar, it will be the right pace for you. Otherwise, it can be \nfairly hard to keep up with the class due to being introduced to the field in just 10 weeks. Charles is a wonderful person though, and is very kind and understanding. He knows his stuff, so don't be afraid to ask for help if needed.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] Great class to learn guitar! The instructor is very nice and helpful. He is also super understanding of how busy everyone is and is ok with you only putting the time you have into the course. You very much get out what you put in.", "[0.85] [Spring 2022] I feel you could learn just as much, if not more, from watching online videos or private lessons. Each class session may have just 3-4 minutes of individual attention. Also knowing basic music theory is highly encouraged to follow along the course. But appreciate the professor's enthusiasm for the course and his stories.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2021] It's a fast moving class but you do learn a lot", "[1.0] [Autumn 2021] This class is a lot fun, but just know you will get out of it what you put into it. You'll likely only see progress if you're really practicing on your own, and attending class is more like a way to check in and hold yourself accountable for improving. It's a very friendly way to start learning from scratch, though, which is great if you're a little intimidated by trying new instruments (like me)!", "[0.0] [Autumn 2021] Whether you're a beginner or an expert, there are many things to be learned from this class.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] I loved this class. So accessible and the prof is super fun to watch play. He's also a fantastic painter, so it's fun to see the musicians he's painted", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Ferguson is a very nice professor and provides great personalized advice. \"Lectures\" can sometimes be a bit tricky to follow but the book is really helpful and he is great if you ask questions. Definitely a class that depends on how much effort you put into it.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2021] This is a great class to brush up guitar skills and also just to relax.

Instructor was going at a fast pace and too difficult to focus on a computer screen", "[0.8] [Winter 2021] Charles is a very skilled guitarist and a fun person to be around. It's always a great way to begin my Tuesday when I have Charles' class early in the morning.", "[0.3] [Winter 2021] It's a good class but very fast-paced! Would recommend a flex or low-unit quarter if you want to get something out of it, because if you just practice in class you might not get super far.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] Charles Ferguson is great and definitely knows his stuff.

It's all classical music so not my first choice of what to play.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] This is a great class! You get out what you put in, so if you practice, you can learn so much. Prof Ferguson is a really funny and easygoing guy, and makes class very entertaining.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] This was my favorite course of the quarter! Charles is the funniest teacher I've ever had, I was literally cracking up throughout every class. Not only is he hilarious, but also a great teacher considering the difficulty of teaching a group of people on different levels. I just wish the class could be twice a week so we could more easily improve our skills.", "[1.0] [Spring 2019] This class is so fun and you learn so much about how to play classical guitar!

The class time isn't really what will make you a good guitar player.", "[-0.6] [Winter 2019] Take it if you really want to learn guitar and will actually practice outside of class. Most of in class time is spent with the teacher telling vanity tales and being slightly racist and sexist every couple of minutes, so you can easily get out of learning anything, but you can't get out of feeling really uncomfortable every class", "[0.4] [Autumn 2018] If you don't know anything about guitar, this is an alright course. All of the instruction, however, comes out of the book, so practice is key. The instructor is there to check the technicalities, but do not plan to have any revelations in playing the guitar.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2018] Not a lot of work.

Charles is such a funny and entertaining professor, and the class is pretty chill. For anyone expecting to simply go to class and learn guitar, that's not going to happen.

I really enjoyed learning classical guitar and would recommend you start playing if you have any interest. However, this course will be a waste of your time. Half the students somehow miraculously already know how to play guitar. The instructor frequently arrived at the room 1-2 minutes late and ended class 5-10 minutes early, which is a lot if you're paying for every minute. Of the <50 minutes of class time, the instructor would almost always spend 10-30 minutes of it talking about unrelated things to fill up the time, like his wife, his concert, or his health problems (which would be fine if we weren't paying to listen to this). When instruction was actually taking place, it was somewhat helpful, but a very small amount of information. Sometimes he would make us play a set of notes and then go around and correct us, which I think was the most helpful aspect of the class, but this was rare. Seriously, just buy the book and maybe follow some videos on youtube. You'll save yourself money and time and probably learn a lot more.

The class is sooo fun!", "[0.0] [Winter 2018] Course is touch-and-go, not very in-depth", "[0.85] [Winter 2018] Good class! You will have fun during class as he has so many anecdotes! To learn guitar though, it is definitely up to you to keep up! As he just gives you the basics.", "[0.95] [Winter 2018] Charles Ferguson is funny and engaging, but most of class is spent on funny anecdotes and there is not much actual instruction or playing time during class. For that reason, I wouldn't recommend this class if you don't have any prior guitar/musical background. Almost all of what I learned was from practicing on my own with the music book. Also, he never posts assignments or anything online, so make sure to note them when he mentions them in class. I enjoyed the class and I'm glad I took it, but it has its limitations.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2017] It's fun, take it!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] This class is pretty chill. Charles knows that most people are in the class to fulfill WAYS so he just tries to make it fun.

Overall, I would recommend.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2017] moves way too fast", "[0.7] [Autumn 2017] If you've never taken a guitar course, recognize that you will not come out of this course knowing how to play the guitar.

That being said, the instructor tends to get a little distracted during class. I wish that the instruction had been a little more formalized so that I could have further developed my skills. You probably won't end the quarter being able to play an actual song or anything, but you will have a lot of fun.", "[0.85] [Spring 2017] Very interesting class that caters to beginners. Professor Ferguson keeps class fun and engaging.", "[0.8] [Spring 2017] Make sure you practice before coming to class! It is also helpful to take notes during the class meetings to help remember things", "[0.55] [Spring 2017] This class was so much fun.", "[0.8] [Spring 2017] Even though the professor is very friendly and knowledgable, he talks a lot in class about non-guitar related things, so you end up not playing too much guitar in class and it ends up being a bit of a \"teach yourself\" course.

The class sessions are too short to really teach multiple people at a time, however--would be nice to have individual lessons if you are trying to really learn guitar.

There's not really a lot of testing of material we've learned in class and we're just expected to pick stuff up on our own.

There were times when it was incredibly fun and interesting, especially when Mark would play a song that I knew and analyze it in a way that I never thought of.

I took this class because I thought it would be a fun, easy way to meet a WAYS requirement. It was certainly easy, but not even slightly engaging, interesting, or useful. That is, unless you find it useful to spend hours of your life sitting in front of a screen while some old man prattles on about how everything is racist and cultural appropriation, and how maybe white people shouldn't be allowed to play the blues. Give me a break, dude... I thought I would get an honest, decent history of rock and roll in this class and instead got some guy's lame ted talk about how rock and roll isn't woke enough. And half the music we listened to wasn't even close to rock and roll. I swear we spent more time listening to Rhianna than we did listening to Led Zeppelin.

It was so fun to sit and talk about music, specifically rock music twice a week.

Take his course.", "[0.65] [Spring 2019] Mark is so fun to have as a teacher. Take a class with him before you graduate", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] Amazing class, one of my favorite at Stanford by far. Mark is phenomenal - passionate about the material, genuinely invested in student's learning and in putting on great lectures. He very eloquently conveys music history, and with unconventional (yet highly effective) pedagogical tools fosters a deeper understanding for the material while keeping everyone entertained. Mark is also a character. A little cocky and narcissistic at times, but these are easily forgiven by myriad other positive traits that contribute to his unique character. I feel the only way to not enjoy this class is if you already have expert knowledge in rock history or you just don't jive with Mark.", "[0.85] [Spring 2019] mark is a lot of fun, and if you want an easy, relatively fun 3 units take it! it does seem to drag on a bit as the quarter goes on though", "[0.8] [Spring 2019] This is the best course I&#x2019;ve ever taken. Applebaum is such a knowledgeable and funny lecturer. I&#x2019;d only recommend it if you plan on going to all the lectures, otherwise you&#x2019;ll have trouble with the pop quizzes.", "[0.7] [Spring 2019] Applebaum is such a cool dude. This is the weirdest class ever. i love it", "[0.9] [Spring 2019] TAKE IT. It is incredible and very interesting. My biggest regret is having to miss a couple of lectures.

I was never overwhelmed by the workload and always looked forward to class.", "[0.65] [Spring 2019] Take it! Mark is awesome", "[-0.1] [Spring 2019] Its good but gets very boring because of the 2 hour lectures. He tends to play a lot of videos and not give explanations.

Mark is one of the most engaging lecturers at this school.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] If you love rock music you MUST try to take this course.

Mark cares so much about this course and teaching and just makes this class a good time to take. take ittt", "[0.9] [Spring 2019] Though Mark is self-indulgent in that a lot of the time he likes to show off his musical talent and show off his connections in the music industry, he is very knowledgeable on the topics and knows how to keep students interested in lecture through funny jokes, visuals, and important/interesting information.", "[0.7] [Spring 2019] This is a fun class to expand your knowledge. It is more than you think.", "[0.8] [Spring 2019] Amazing class. Applebaum is so eccentric and fun.", "[0.6] [Spring 2019] There is a pop quiz about 50% of the time, so make sure you are prepared, and go lecture!", "[0.8] [Spring 2019] This is a great class, just make sure you attend lectures and don't miss too many quizzes.", "[0.65] [Spring 2019] TAKE THIS CLASS. By far the best class I've taken at Stanford so far.", "[0.9] [Spring 2019] This is a great A-II. Work load is not bad at all.

It was the best course I have taken at Stanford so far! Absolutely loved it, prof. Applebaum is incredibly engaging, and really expanded my opinion about different musical genres.", "[0.5] [Spring 2019] No matter what genre of music you like to listen to, this class has something to teach you and I guarantee you will leave the course not listening to music the same way you did when you first walked in.", "[-0.05] [Spring 2019] Although I learned a lot in this course, I would not recommend it. Mark is narcissistic and conceited. Who makes their own concert worth 5% of the class grade? Come on.", "[0.85] [Spring 2019] This is perhaps my favorite class at Stanford. Mark is the most engaging and wonderful professor I've ever had.", "[0.0] [Spring 2019] Take it!", "[0.8] [Spring 2019] This is the best class I have taken at Stanford.

The course is fun to watch sometimes because he plays lots of music and sometimes even brings his own instruments, but it is very much a lecture with little to no space for questions or discussions.", "[0.6] [Spring 2019] Great class and not a lot of work.", "[0.25] [Spring 2019] Learn a lot about music and theory. If you are someone who doesn't like going to class don't take this class! I was someone who was fine with being in every lecture so the attendance policy did not bother me.", "[0.8] [Spring 2019] You should definitely take this course. It's a fun way to learn some really important music history and some perspectives on that history. Do be aware that it's not a blow off course though.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] The first three weeks of lectures were beautifully put together and thoroughly interesting. Unfortunately, the quality of the lectures decreased as the course ground on. Some aspects of the course were quite self-indulgent on the part of Applebaum; requiring students to attend his personal concert (peripherally related to rock music at best), spending a week of lecture discussing his friends from Sweden, and requiring students to listen to him play guitar riffs for >1hr. Applebaum is prone to letting his personal interests sway the content of the course too far from the marketed syllabus. His positively hostile attitude towards student athletes is also of concern.  While these elements of the course bothered me, there can be no doubt that Applebaum is a passionate educator and is fiercely knowledgeable about music of all genres.", "[0.8] [Spring 2019] Don't miss lecture, there is almost always an assignment/quiz! Mark is a phenomenal lecturer and lectures are really fun despite being 2 hours long. If you listen to music and enjoy music you really should take this class.", "[0.7] [Spring 2019] Applebaum WILL call you out for being on your phone or laptop in lecture and its 2h long which is a lot. He's a good lecturer tho and material is interesting", "[0.7] [Spring 2019] It's amazing, you learn so much about rock music and it's origins as well as punk, grunge, psychedelia, blues, and jazz. It's enriching", "[0.85] [Spring 2019] Great course! Very interesting if you want to learn more about the history of rock music and how it has evolved over the years.", "[0.85] [Spring 2019] I would 110% recommend it. This is one of those must-take classes at Stanford. Dr. Applebaum's instruction is incredible and the lectures are incredibly engaging. You get a full-down overarching insight into the history of music, as well as the tools to analyze music even if you are not a \"musical person\". I thoroughly enjoyed this course.", "[0.85] [Spring 2019] Take this course! One of the most fun, engaging classes I've taken at Stanford. Always go to lecture, study a bit for the quizzes, and have fun with the assignments.", "[0.6] [Spring 2019] It's a great senior spring class that you'll learn a lot from", "[0.6] [Spring 2019] If you're able to attend all of the classes and really invest, then it's an awesome course to take", "[1.0] [Spring 2019] There are so many reasons to take this class and I know I won't be able to cover them all here. If you like or just want to learn more about rock music, take it. If you want to learn about how pop music evolved to where it is today, take it. If you want to have a professor who is a genius piano player and also plays guitar, bass, and drums in class on occasion, take it. If you enjoy engaging lecturers who clearly put thought into the best way to convey course concepts to a classroom, take it. If you like listening to music, take it (Professor Applebaum plays a lot of music in class). It is one of the most fun and engaging classes I've taken at Stanford.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] This class is fantastic! Mark is an amazing lecturer who gives you newfound appreciation for the music you know and love, even if you think you know the history already. Even though the course teaches you a lot, it still has a very manageable workload. I'd highly recommend that anyone take this class to learn more about the complex history of rock music, how to critically evaluate music, and how intimately music, culture, and values are intertwined.", "[0.9] [Spring 2019] This is a fun and easy course to be a part of. The assignments are truthfully a little tedious and don't further the lectures much at all. For example, a graffiti art assignment that was somehow supposed to help us relate to underground hip-hop culture by drawing our names in grafitti styles.", "[0.9] [Spring 2017] A must take!  Truly outstanding  Professor Applebaum is amazing", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] Regardless of interest in music of any kind, take this course.  Mark is unique in his enthusiasm, engagement, raw intellectual power, insightfulness, passion, spontaneity and entertainment value", "[0.0] [Spring 2017] take it!", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] This is a really fun class. Mark Applebaum is funny, makes lectures interesting, and gives fun assignments such as graffiti art, writing song lyrics, and writing a music review for our final paper. It's not a homework heavy class, but the papers and other projects can be more challenging, as they require lots of thinking and analysis. Coming to a better understanding of music (including some of your favorite songs) is quite satisfying.", "[0.45] [Spring 2017] good class", "[0.45] [Spring 2017] Definitely take it!", "[0.8] [Spring 2017] I recommend it to anyone and everyone, but especially if you are into music. Applebaum is amazing.", "[0.85] [Spring 2017] Awesome class. Mark keeps the class fun and the assignments are engaging", "[0.85] [Spring 2017] This is a very fulfilling class with meaningful and entertaining lectures, as well as interesting assignments.", "[0.9] [Spring 2017] This is a really fun class to take but some friends of mine have said that the lecture time is a bit too long especially when you have a lot of work to be doing. Maybe take this when you're looking for a fun quarter but not drowning in work!", "[0.9] [Spring 2017] I would highly recommend this course, even you're just remotely interested in music. This is a great coverage of music throughout history and how it has shaped our lives and society. Everybody could benefit from taking this course.", "[0.6] [Spring 2017] It's a really interesting course, but only take it if you're really prepared to show up to two 2hr lectures every week consistently", "[0.85] [Spring 2017] It is a unique class that covers a lot of genres of music. Some might not be genres that you like, but it is interesting to learn where they come from and what they draw inspiration from.", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] Whether it is to satisfy your WAYS requirement or to learn about the basics and history of mainstream genres of music, I feel this course should be taken by every single student at Stanford. I have been inspired and have a very new perspective on different genres of music (Note that this class does not focus solely on rock music: it's about metal, pop, hip-hop, folk, and you name it..). This course will channel your inner musician and will truly rock you to your core.  Also, you might be thinking that 1hr 50mins would've been hard to sit through. Well, not at all! Professor Applebaum keeps the class engaging throughout. Trust me on this, you're missing out on something if you don't take this class in your time at Stanford. So add it to your Stanford (TO-DO) checklist and get rocking!", "[0.9] [Spring 2017] I would recommend this class to anyone interested in Rock music and its history, as long as they know that the class is not one that they can simply skip because it is \"fun.\" Know that there are pop quizzes about lecture material and the course should be taken seriously even though it is fun!", "[0.75] [Spring 2017] Very fun and interesting class.", "[0.55] [Spring 2017] very very good", "[0.9] [Spring 2017] If you love music (especially rock) as much as I do, TAKE IT. Mark is a teaching god, and he always finds a new way to teach the material. Weeks 5-7, as well as Johan and Frederick, were the best parts of the class.", "[0.65] [Spring 2017] probably the best class that I took at Stanford, 10/10. Take it!", "[0.75] [Spring 2017] Take it! Mark is an incredibly entertaining professor, and regardless of your taste in music, he will make the course interesting", "[0.15] [Spring 2017] Definitely take this course. There is a method to Applebaum's madness. I enjoyed every day of lecture and every project that was assigned. Words can not suffice so I shall stop here: take it.", "[0.85] [Spring 2017] definitely a lot of work for a 3 unit, but definitely an entertaining unique class", "[0.5] [Spring 2017] It's fun! You'll be exposed to types of music you've never heard before", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] Applebaum is a brilliant lecturer and a talented musician. He designed a pretty spectacular overview of rock music and music appreciation in general thats accessible for any music background. He can come off as a bit condescending at times, but is truly a great teacher.", "[0.8] [Spring 2017] It's a fun way to get a WAYS requirement out of the way while having an engaging lecturer and minimal work. It's nice to learn about music.", "[-0.4] [Spring 2017] Overall, this course is organized, but each lecture is disorganized. The course assignments are not relevant to the class.", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] 100% would recommend. Extremely interesting, and you get to listen to great music everyday. Mark Applebaum is a wonderful and engaging professor. Not a big time commitment.", "[0.85] [Spring 2017] It's a fun class, and you do learn a lot from the assignments. If you know a fair amount about music history, don't expect to learn too much on that aspect, but interesting connections/observations are still made, so it is worth it even if you think you (or you do) know it all", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] Really fun and interesting course. No midterm or final, just quizzes, a presentation and 2 papers. The papers are fun to write and the workload really isn't that bad. Abblebaum is a great lecturer and is really entertaining.", "[0.4] [Spring 2017] Professor is kind of a dick about assignments and class attendance, but a good look at the evolution of pop music in the US", "[0.85] [Spring 2017] Mark is a very eccentric lecturer who is clearly passionate and well educated on the subject. I found his lecture style appealing and uplifting, but I know that others found it off-putting. Be prepared to spend over a third of this class on non-rock and roll topics (early era blues and jazz), but from my experience I would highly recommend taking this class.", "[0.0] [Spring 2017] Too much work for three units", "[0.75] [Spring 2017] I think it is a good and fun music class", "[0.85] [Spring 2017] I'd suggest taking it because I learned a great deal about music. Taking this class has allowed for me to have more appreciation for music", "[0.8] [Spring 2017] Professor Applebaum is one of Stanford's truly exceptional faculty and you should definitely pursue every opportunity to take this class.", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] This class is quite fun! I'm not sure if office hours are useful, but I'm under the impression that I should have gone. Also, eat lunch with Mark! HE IS AWESOME", "[0.8] [Spring 2017] Mark is phenomenal and this class rocks (pun intended). The blend of music listening/watching and discussions is perfect and I enjoyed every moment. One of the few classes at Stanford where I would voluntarily go to more lectures if I could.", "[0.8] [Spring 2017] I would 110% recommend this course! This was one of the funnest classes at Stanford. I genuinely felt excited to learn  and hardly got bored with the material.", "[0.0] [Spring 2017] The class session is very long. The in class quizzes are harder then they need to be.", "[-0.55] [Spring 2017] ambiguous grading, horrible random quiz-attendace policy", "[0.6] [Spring 2017] A very fun class! You learn all about the history of rock", "[-0.3] [Spring 2017] don't take this. The lectures are 2 hours twice a week, there are 10 pop quizzes that count for 25% of your grade, 2 6-page papers, and a presentation for only 3 units. Applebaum talks for 2 hours straight just about whatever comes to his mind and it is incredibly painful.", "[0.75] [Spring 2017] Really cool way to get background on the history of rock/popular music. It seems like Mark sometimes says things purely for the sake of shock value, but he's otherwise a knowledgeable and entertaining professor.", "[0.0] [Spring 2017] Listen to the music outside of class! It will add to the learning experience.", "[0.35] [Spring 2017] standup comedy everyday", "[0.7] [Spring 2017] The lectures are very educational, and Applebaum does a good job of exposing students to different aspects of music. The lectures are a little on the long side, however; I feel that the lectures would be a tad bit more engaging with something like 80 minute lectures rather than 110 minute lectures.", "[0.25] [Spring 2017] Incredible class taught by one of the coolest professors at Stanford. Go to every lecture and put away your phone- it's worth it.", "[0.6] [Spring 2017] great class", "[0.6] [Spring 2017] Great class", "[0.8] [Spring 2017] Do it! But read the syllabus and mark important dates in your calendar ahead of time. Idk if there's any other course like this at Stanford, so take advantage of that.", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] Take it and you won't regret it. Mark is an amazing lecturer, he is passionate about the material and is truly interested in making your time worth. The assignments are not particularly time-consuming and add a nice touch to the class. The range of music you will listen to is incredible and gives you a whole new perspective on the art. Take. It.", "[0.7] [Spring 2017] Really interesting course. More of a time commitment than you'd expect. Not a joke class. Worth it if you're willing to put in the time for the few assignments", "[0.85] [Spring 2017] It's titled \"Rock, Sex, and Rebellion,\" what more do you need to know? But honestly Mark Applebaum always keeps it real and makes it very interesting every day.", "[0.9] [Spring 2017] Excellent course with an incredibly passionate and insightful professor. Really glad I took this class!", "[0.9] [Spring 2017] Lots of your preconceptions about what a college class on rock music would be like are probably true. Lectures don't offer a ton of historical or musical insight -- lots of big words but not many big ideas. If you have a basic understanding of the history of guitar music you're probably 95% of the way there. Musical examples supporting lectures are infuriatingly conventional. No phones/laptops, a bunch of pop quizzes, and assignments that feel unnecessarily long. Oh, and expect to get lectured about why drugs are bad.Focus on commercial pop music at the beginning felt forced and didn't seem to fit well with the rest of the course. Module on African music could have been better fleshed out. Way too much Beatles worship. Not nearly enough Velvet Underground, Stooges, Zappa, Monks, 13th Floor Elevators, Doors, or any rock music at all from outside the US/Britain. Would benefit from more focus on electronic music, psych rock, post-punk, and the more experimental fringes of rock music.", "[0.5] [Spring 2017] Very entertaining and makes you think about music differently.", "[0.8] [Spring 2017] Great course -- really enjoyable and you learn a lot!", "[0.0] [Spring 2017] Take it!", "[-0.1] [Spring 2017] This will change the way you think about music, and is the ultimate spring quarter course! Not a crazy commitment at all, and it isn't always necessary to stay for the whole duration of class if it's too long or you have other things to do.", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] Unbelievable class to anyone who enjoys music and would like to learn more.  Mark is a great teacher who keeps class fun.  The assignments are also very fun.", "[0.8] [Spring 2017] The class is very interesting and Professor Applebaum is great. The papers are bit long.", "[0.85] [Spring 2017] Definitely take it. Its an entertaining class with a great professor", "[0.35] [Spring 2017] It's great! the papers are really annoying though.", "[0.75] [Spring 2017] It can get political in a weird way at times, but this is a cool way to learn about rock/pop music, and an interesting introduction to music classes at Stanford.", "[0.85] [Spring 2017] Fun material but keep in mind that there is a significant time commitment as the lectures (4 hours a week) are mandatory and there are also two papers and a presentation as well as a few other assignments.", "[0.9] [Spring 2017] Definitely do, Prof. Applebaum is great and the content is awesome. Also meets AII or ED", "[0.8] [Spring 2017] It's not really too much about rock, but it's still great!", "[0.9] [Spring 2017] This is definitely a pretty interesting course. Not too much work. Great for fulfilling ways.", "[0.65] [Spring 2017] It's an interesting way to knock off some requirements. Lectures can be quite long, but the content is interesting.", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] If you are interested in the stories behind rock, and want to listen to amazing music in class, take this course. There wasn't a minute that went by where I wasn't invested in the material. Applebaum is also a musically brilliant, friendly, and hilarious professor.", "[0.9] [Spring 2017] Take the class. It is a lot of fun and super interesting. Even if you are in 20 units you will not regret it.", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] This is THE course to take on popular music - Mark Applebaum is a great lecturer that is very well-versed in the topic and is clearly passionate about it. His fluency with the digital media that he uses in class also contributes to its flow. There are some lectures that really don't teach much - like the day he had students compete to identify guitar riffs for a solid hour and twenty minutes - but Mark means well and makes this class fun and accessible, even for those inexperienced with musical analysis.", "[-0.15] [Spring 2017] It's enjoyable but really drags on especially with its a 2 hour lecture time", "[0.3] [Spring 2017] Fun topic but too much work for this many units.", "[0.0] [Spring 2017] they grade the papers harshly", "[0.75] [Spring 2017] It's cool. Definition of a survey course; take one of the seminar classes if you want a super in-depth look at one of the genres covered (i.e., Mark's British Invasion course, Charlie Kronengold's African-American Soul Tradition, etc.)"], "MUSIC 80A": [], "MUSIC 801": [], "MUSIC 802": [], "NATIVEAM 100": ["[0.95] [Autumn 2021] This is a great class to learn information that is not taught elsewhere. It is not a very difficult course and Mike is a great person and delightful professor.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2021] This course acknowledges Native history in a way that is valuable and comforting as a Native student. I felt I had a place to voice my opinions and listen to others. We were all able to discuss and connect with one another.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] It is an interesting class that focuses on various native concepts and explores the different aspects of Indigenous people in the Americas. I would definitely recommend taking it! You get to build a community with those around you and maybe even take a fun field trip like our class did to the Santa Cruz mountainsn while gaining a stronger understanding of Indigenous People.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] So much information about Native Americans. The beautiful culture they have was awesome to learn about. The insane hardships their people endured was crushing to learn about and know the truth. Must take course. Learn so much. So applicable to real world knowledge. Mike is the best professor ever. Absolutely loved this course, my favorite course at Stanford and its not even close.", "[0.15] [Autumn 2021] Great class, learn lots non stressfully", "[1.0] [Autumn 2021] Definitely take this class! I'm a Native student who cultivated great community and friendships taking this class with other Indigenous peoples, but wanted to note that the presence of non-Native allies was very much appreciated as well. The exploitation of Indigenous land, bodies, and labor is at the center of the U.S.'s founding and contemporary functioning, so it's really important to see how that manifests in society today\u2014and be able to critique it and imagine beyond it. Prof. Mike Wilcox is great at centering student voices and well-being, including extensions if you just need some time/space for mental health. You get to discuss plenty, and Prof. Mike is great at connecting what you learn to the community and making it feel relevant. For instance, this year's final involves thinking beyond land acknowledgments and working to support Ohlone communities. You also watch and analyze the Hulu show Rez Dogs (definitely check it out!) for this class.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] Great class! Learned a lot and professor was the best!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] This class is incredible. I think it should be a required class for all people, especially those who grew up within the so-called United States of America.  Compared to other professors, Mike may seem a bit disorganized, but he is a brilliant man with an incredible pedagogy; he will change your worldview without you even realizing it. I had an amazing time in this class. It became a community. There was also a really great mix of learning strategies--story, lecture, speakers, films, discussion, field trip. I loved it! The only thing that was a bit stressful is that some weeks you have no readings, and other weeks you have 100+ pages of recommended reading. So the inconsistency is a little tricky if you're really into a schedule", "[1.0] [Autumn 2021] what a wonderful class -- take it. Mike may seem disorganized but it's really because he adjusts to what he hears students wanting to learn. There is so much valuable content in this course around decolonization and indigenous futurity and learning about the indigenous people of this land -- it doesn't fit in 10 weeks but this is a good start. Go on the field trips because they are really valuable and learn from your peers in class. If you're not Native and worried about it, definitely still take this class -- it's welcoming to all levels of knowledge and really a great learning community because we want to decolonize and indigenize spaces together.", "[0.6] [Winter 2021] I would say take it! It is amazing to learn about many of these hidden histories that are absent from dominant studies.", "[0.7] [Winter 2021] Would recommend this class! it is really informative and a really cool space to come to every week!", "[0.55] [Winter 2021] This course offers students the chance to learn how to decolonize different institutions. In this course, students will find themselves meeting many Native leaders in a space where questions are encouraged and where students can learn from each other perspectives.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] This has been my absolute favorite course I have taken at Stanford. Karen Biestman is an incredible professor. She is so kind, caring, and knowledgeable. I am a non-Native student, and learned so much taking this course. The lessons I learned here, I hope to take with me in everything I do, in my academic, professional, and personal life. May we all support Indigenous people, Indigenous rights, and work toward decolonization", "[0.5] [Winter 2021] Definitely take it, even if you are not interested in Native American studies it could help you revaluate societal presumptions", "[0.45] [Winter 2021] This course is a very good basis for understanding Native studies as a study themselves. It's very interesting to see this concept broken down both as a discipline within the academy and then reframed as a network of knowledges that supercede and pre-date the academy altogether.", "[0.4] [Winter 2021] This course is a phenomenal introduction to Native studies. It is not overwhelming in assignments or grading yet still emphasizes Indigenous academic decolonization and growth."], "NATIVEAM 103S": ["[0.75] [Autumn 2018] I highly recommend taking this class. I learned a lot about gender roles in Native American societies. I also really enjoyed reading the texts for this class.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2018] This class is really awesome, and it resulted in a lot of really great in-class discussions. Most of the class is spent discussing the novels, so if you are the type of person who likes to go without doing the required readings or easily falls behind on readings I would not recommend. However, all of the novels were really great and interesting. If you have never taken a Native Studies course before or aren't familiar with Native culture I would not recommend this course as a gateway just because I think you will get more out of it if you already have some familiarity with the topics. All in all it was a great course and I am happy I took it.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2017] This course is great - enjoyed the discussions, readings, and the professor. Still, the focus is not much on gender and more about literature. If that is fine with you, then I would recommend taking it, but if you want the focus to be heavily on gender, then I would not take the course.", "[0.4] [Autumn 2017] Only take this class if you're willing to deeply engage with the texts. The students lead the discussion in class, so if you're not willing to read the books you wouldn't be able to contribute.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] It was a really cool experience to be able to read so many novels for a class, in a way that didn't feel overwhelming, but that felt really rewarding and was really engaging."], "NATIVEAM 109A": ["[0.9] [Winter 2022] I highly recommend this class if you are at all interested in law and Indigeneity!

I couldn't recommend it more.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] I would highly recommend this course because you really gain so much knowledge that can help you in the future with other assignments or projects.", "[0.6] [Winter 2022] Great class.", "[0.75] [Winter 2022] It is definitely an interesting topic if you're interested in Federal Indian Law or law in general. However, it was hard (at least for me) to understand how to relate the class content to the assignments and final.", "[0.5] [Winter 2022] Take this class! It is very interesting and provides foundational information on what you need to know when studying Native-centered issues surrounding sovereignty and treaty rights.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] I totally recommend if you want an intro to federal Indian law, Karen is amazing at lecture. Readings are manageable as well. Only 2 major assignments worth a big portion of your grade, so note that. The final is also worth 50%, so consider taking it P/F if you don't need it for major.", "[0.45] [Winter 2022] Karen's papers are no joke. They aren't long but keeping to only 5 pages is the difficulty. It is hard to answer all questions/parts of a prompt in only five pages, so take them seriously and give yourself time to do them. Obviously Karen is great though and you can ask her questions, etc. You won't regret taking this course", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] This course provides excellent insight into the relationship between tribal, state, and federal governments. Professor Biestman is an excellent instructor and is really knowledgeable about the subject area. Make sure to receive seek feedback from her on your paper drafts before turning in the final versions of the papers.", "[0.65] [Winter 2022] Great class!", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Definitely take it! Karen is such a fantastic professor and has the most fantastic guests join class too. Everyone should take one of Karen's classes before they graduate.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Absolutely take this course! Karen is an amazing lecturer and the material is so important and interesting. You will engage with all facets of the law pertaining to Native peoples. The papers are challenging but super rewarding and thought provoking. I was excited to attend lecture each week and I never failed to learn something new! Not to mention \u2026 Karen always brings snacks for us. Take it!!!", "[0.8] [Winter 2022] As a Native American student, this is a must-take course. The professor is great and very friendly.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] This is a great introduction to tribal governance and politics in the historical and contemporary United States through the lens of the law. It's a well-taught survey course, but if you're looking to get into greater detail on any one area of Native law, there's not a ton of opportunity for that here. Class is not heavy on technical legal jargon so it's very accessible to students without extensive experiences in law classes. Karen has a very interesting and relevant background and is well-spoken on all topics.", "[0.6] [Winter 2022] Commit to the readings, and take notes when the guest lecturer speaks (it may be on the prompt or useful in writing the papers).", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] I LOVE KAREN! This class was an excellent use of my time. Take it! It's a little difficult if you have no previous knowledge (like I did) but definitely do-able and you'll learn a lot", "[0.75] [Winter 2017] It is a great way to think about law. I recommend a general law background with this class", "[0.5] [Winter 2017] Take good notes!", "[0.75] [Winter 2017] Karen is very passionate and her class is very interesting.", "[0.75] [Winter 2017] This is a deeply fascinating course.

Much great learning about the Ohlone both inside the classroom and outside (via field trips).", "[0.45] [Spring 2022] I would highly recommend this class! Students are provided with an understanding of California Native culture while also getting hands-on experience through the CEL component.", "[0.85] [Spring 2022] Definitely take this class! It is so empowering and very important to learn about the history of the land we are on at Stanford. It is such a unique class in that I feel it actually taught me something meaningful and useful for my life.", "[0.45] [Spring 2022] Take this class!!! Mike is the best- he is a little disorganized but you learn so much.", "[0.0] [Spring 2022] This course is a must, especially for all of us who are guests on Muwekma Ohlone land during our time at Stanford. I thought it was impactful to learn about Muwekma Ohlone cosmologies, histories, and present-day movements, and to spend time in an academic class reckoning with my positionality and responsibilities as an Indigenous settler.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] It is a very engaging course in terms of community engagement and you gain a better sense of the people of this area and how we can work to better their futures. I would also say that the professor is very understanding and takes time to help you learn the objectives of the course. If there was a must-take course at Stanford, I would say this one because it centers the needs and voices of the Muwekma Ohlone people, who are the original people of this land that we temporarily occupy for school.", "[0.6] [Spring 2022] Mike is a great instructor", "[0.6] [Spring 2022] Mike is a fantastic professor! There are very few, if any other courses/places on campus where you can learn the material and skills you'll learn in Mike's class.", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] Prof. Wilcox is great. His teaching style is not traditional by any means but he really cares about what he is doing and makes lessons interesting and curated to what students what to learn about", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] the opportunity to work with the Muwekma tribe is really unique and super formative -- definitely take it!! The field trips feel like a lot to go to, but as soon as you're there are so nice -- mentally, physically, academically.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2020] Extremely well taught. First major STEM class at Stanford that was not overwhelming or taught with an odd, competitive power dynamic. The teachers actually cared about our wellbeing as students.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2020] 100% take it, very interesting course. Prof. Wilcox tries to keep the class fluid so that we cover our interests.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Michael is amaing and super supportive. He inspired the whole class deeply. The field trips were so fun and meaningful.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] This is an extremely valuable course. It should be required for all Stanford students. Not only does it discuss the grossly underrepresented history and modern life of Native Americans, specifically the Ohlone people, it also provides venues to directly benefit the dialogue between Stanford and indigenous by way of projects. The work is not hard and extremely rewarding. Michael Wilcox emphasizes the engagement of native students and values their contributions. Would 1000000% recommend.", "[-0.3] [Autumn 2019] This course is incredible for people who have no knowledge on the history of California Native peoples. Everyone should take this class", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] This class was a real breath of fresh air! Mike is an unconventional teacher--he's pretty disorganized--but he emphasizes self-care, creativity, community, and restfulness in a way that makes his class a safe space for learning and talking.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Really weird class. Almost no workload, but I hardly learned anything all quarter. Random \"required\" field trips were interesting but people seldom went on all of them because of their difficult timings (mainly fri, sat, and sun). Wilcox is really nice but super disorganized. Would not recommend this class unless you really just want to get a super easy 5 units.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] I loved this course and would definitely recommend taking it if you can! Wilcox is a great teacher and if you have the change I would try to take a class with him. He makes you think and learn in different ways which I have loved!!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] DEFINITELY TAKE IT. Mike does an amazing job of using relevant work outside of the classroom, engaging lectures and indigenous student experience to make the class really poignant and important.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2019] DO IT!!!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] Its an amazing course taught by an amazing professor. No other class like it at Stanford.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] I sadly would not be able to recommend this course. The potential is so so high. Wilcox is a wealth of knowledge, and he has so so much to offer the class. His enthusiasm is contagious. But the disorganization of the class means we don't really come away with what we could have. A lot of time is lost in disorganization. Would not recommend. Unless you are mentally prepared for that and want to take a super easy class but also learn a few things here and there.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2019] absolutely take this course. Mike cares so incredibly much about his students and about cultivating a community among his students. Throughout the course, the class partners alongside indigenous Muwekma leaders to work on service-learning projects--this quarter we worked on starting a Native plants garden at Stanford, or reexamining California history curriculum involving Native histories. This has been one of my favorite courses at Stanford, by far.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2019] Mike Wilcox is an excellent professor and you will definitely learn a lot, even in ways you would not have expected to.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2019] I don't recommend taking this course. Stanford should absolutely offer classes about the history of this place and its people, as well as on Muwekma's culture and knowledge and how students can be of service to the tribe. Unfortunately, this class did not meet these goals.  This was the least organized and least democratic class I've ever taken. Readings were inconsistently assigned and never covered in class, so students didn't have the opportunity to teach and learn from each other through discussion. Lectures were sporadic and very redundant. They typically involved the instructor telling students that what we previously had been taught was bad and what we were supposed to believe instead, without providing evidence upon which to base our new prescribed belief. He also didn't provide opportunities for us to learn and practice new skills so that we could do better scholarship. Most of the field trips and some of the assignments were scheduled last minute, which was not only frustrating and unfair to anyone who has substantial extracurricular commitments but inequitable to low-income students who have to work.  This course could be drastically improved if there were a full syllabus provided at the outset of the quarter. The syllabus should have all the readings, assignments, and field trips scheduled from weeks 1-10, as well as final project benchmarks listed for weeks 5-10.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2018] Take it. Wilcox has been one of my favorite professors. Take the class, if only to work with and learn from him. The subject matter is something that ALL Stanford students should be required to learn. You will be a better person after this class.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] Absolutely absolutely take it.  You will love Professor Wilcox, but also his class.  He is such a knowledgeable professor.  He really makes us understand the importance of Native American culture and the history behind it.  He is such a kind professor.  You will come out of the class not only feeling intelligent but also you come out of the class with a connection with one of the greatest professors at Stanford.  You will really love it and won't regret taking this class.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] take it! Professor Wilcox ensures that the classroom becomes a community where everyone takes care of one another-- never before at Stanford have I experienced such an intense bond with my fellow classmates. They have become my friends. We went on a large number of really interesting field trips and I feel that I walk away with a greater questioning of the history that is told to me. I wonder how much the discipline of history implies an erasure of certain narratives; this class is the uncovering of the untold.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] Mike is a fabulous professor- he is very engaged in students' learning and has lots of interesting things to say. The course is mostly field-trip and guest speaker based. Have a LOT of flexibility in your planning- this is not a traditional course, and field-trips pop up and are extended on-the-fly. A fabulous course!", "[0.0] [Autumn 2018] Take it take it take it! This has been one of the most impactful classes I have taken at Stanford. More than concrete skills or specific knowledge, this class teaches you to grow and change your perspective on the still living cultures of California Indians", "[0.5] [Autumn 2017] A great course for those who have little to no knowledge about the Muwekma Ohlone tribe.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2017] This class provides an introduction to Bay Area indigenous history and archaeology, through a uniquely structured pedagogy involving lots of trips, guest lectures, and lectures. Professor Wilcox's teaching style is unconventional, in that he does very little formal lecturing, instead arranging opportunities to learn from and talk with local archaeological/anthropological experts, and to spend time visiting local missions, archaeological sites, and historically important spaces. In this way, you are able to get a broad introduction to the complex network of elements (environmental, social, political, etc.) that have shaped the place we live during our four years at Stanford. Anthro111B can be frustrating at times, because there is an unpredictable class schedule, and oftentimes little or no opportunities to have conversations with other students in the class (days are spent either entirely on lectures or adventuring to a fieldsite/to talk with an expert). However, this hands on approach is hugely refreshing within a department that mostly focuses on theory, and Professor Wilcox's enthusiasm and deep investment in this area and the people really comes through.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2017] Mike is an incredible human and if you are every considering a course with him I would recommend. He is knowledgable about his subject areas and cares tremendously about his students. He always checks in to make sure we are okay on a human level. He cares about our problems and what is happening in our lives. He clearly wants everyone to walk away feeling empowered and to learn the things that are most interesting to them. He opens himself up to let the class help guide the course, which I really appreciated. He made me feel excited to learn in ways that I don't always feel in other courses here. I felt like he wanted me to learn the material and enjoy learning the material, with no tricks or unnecessary bullshit.", "[0.15] [Autumn 2017] It's really interesting but not really taught like other courses you've taken--it's not exactly something where you check all the boxes and then you've learned everything; it's more about you having tools to create your own understanding about the world."], "NATIVEAM 112": ["[0.8] [Autumn 2022] Great course! If you are interested in Native American studies and want a more hands-on academic routine this is the course for you.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2022] This course is so worthwhile and meaningful. The class was able to learn more about plants and the intersections of community, culture, and land.", "[0.35] [Autumn 2022] This course is unique to any course I have taken, including other outdoors project courses. This course pushed me to reflect on the relationality between humans and land across time and space in ways I will value for the rest of my life. Michael Wilcox provides invaluable expertise on the subject of indigenous land relations in general and the specific histories of the Muwekma Ohlone and other peoples indigenous to the area we call the Bay.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] This is a hands on class that is very community oriented. You connect to the Muwekma community and create a community of your own in class. The instructor truly cares about his students and about ensuring Native students in particular have a space to learn, grow, and imagine.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2022] Take it", "[0.55] [Autumn 2022] This is such a great opportunity to learn about Native plants, but also to have a different type of learning environment that isn't the same as your typical classes. It's very interactive and extremely educational.", "[0.4] [Autumn 2022] It would be nice to hear about the field trips further in advance.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] As a non-Indigenous white student, if speaking to other non-indigenous students seeking to take the course, I highly encourage you to take it if you are ready to actively and sometimes challengingly constantly assess the space you take and make and interrogate what you have to offer. Then joyfully and generously offer it! Also - go to all the field trips. Drop everything and go to them.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2022] I would highly recommend this class especially if you are interested in being part of a longer term project and building relationships with the indigenous native community."], "NATIVEAM 114": ["[0.75] [Autumn 2022] Highly recommend to native students because the professor's style of teaching Native American history is very respectful and insightful!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] If you are looking for an introductory course on Native American history I would recommend this one. The course is very flexible as we only meet once a week, there are heavy readings but you have plenty of time to complete and you only have to write three papers.

You aren\u2019t allowed to use outside sources. Readings are super interesting."], "NATIVEAM 115": ["[1.0] [Winter 2022] 7/10. A solid course with room for improvements. To start off, Professor Delphine is an incredibly knowledgeable educator and was pretty flexible and understanding. She shares her personal connections to the material and had lots of depth to her lectures. With that being said, this class is very lecture heavy and there is a lot of content to cover. Readings and responses for every class (twice a week) and then 2 short papers (5 to 8 pages) then a longer paper with an oral presentation (12 to 15 pages). Feels like 5 units of work but with proper time management, manageable. The material we were studying was definitely very important and relevant; Professor Delphine did a good job of making that happen. Readings were insightful to the lectures and made discussions more interesting. Along with the good, there were some negatives. Particularly the organization of the class was a little rough. At times, especially at the beginning of the quarter, the expectations for assignments were unclear. The Canvas assignments weren't uploaded in a timely manner to allow a clear time of when submission was required. The version of the textbook we needed was a little chaotic trying to get as well. Despite, I would still recommend this class!", "[0.45] [Winter 2022] Good introductory course to Native Americans", "[0.75] [Winter 2021] This course allows you to understand Native American history through a Native perspective.

If you don't do the readings, you will learn very little. The reading volume can be fairly high. That said, I learned a great deal.", "[0.3] [Autumn 2021] If you are Californian, you must take this course. An effective introduction to many foundational concepts and techniques in Native Studies, you will learn a tremendous amount about the abhorrent, and abhorrently understudied, genocide which took place within CA. Prof. Anderson does an excellent job presenting this troubling history carefully and comprehensively, effectively striking the delicate balance between a more-dispassionate academic examination of colonialism/erasure and centering individual and emotionally-charged accounts/experiences. It is also a well-structured course that does not have very much work, and every assignment contributes directly to your learning and understanding (less work and reading than most other upper-level History classes).", "[0.35] [Autumn 2021] Overall, this was a fine course and in the end I did learn a lot. The readings unfortunately are almost entirely written by non-Native historians, though, so you need to be skilled at being critical & skeptical of what you read and not just take what they say at face value. I can't say that all my classmates had that intuition, & we didn't often engage with the readings in a critical way. It would have been great to read more scholarly work by California Natives. The discussions were also a bit lackluster; Prof. Anderson would usually just ask for our \"reactions\" to the reading, which led to a lot of white students telling everyone how shocking it was that the California Genocide had been intentional, how surprised they were by the cruelty of the missionaries, or how they had no idea that these issues have persisted until today. I'm not Native myself, but I would consider these sorts of comments & discussions to be microaggressions (or maybe just flat out macroaggressions), and the professor doesn't push back on them much, if at all. She is very kind, though, and despite the syllabus saying she doesn't accept late work she's actually very accommodating. \n\nIF YOU'RE A WHITE STUDENT THINKING OF TAKING THIS COURSE, maybe do some reflection on your positionality & the space you'll take up in a class like this? I am not suggesting you DON'T take it, just that you think before you speak. If you've never thought about this history before your comments will probably actually be really un-insightful and you & everyone else will get more out of the class if you mostly just listen & ask questions.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2021] Good class to learn about history.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] This is likely one of the most valuable courses offered at Stanford if you are interested in understanding your existence on this land from a non-colonial point of view.

I thought the student instructors worked super well together, and did a great job of creating class community\u2014from our first discussion of values until our final class potluck. I also really appreciated how the expectations they created for discussion allowed everyone to contribute with excitement and energy while still centering analyses in the experiences of Kanaka Maoli students, which made it feel like our discussions were truly building towards ea and ku<U+02BB>oko<U+02BB>a for the lahui.", "[0.0] [Spring 2022] take it!", "[1.0] [Spring 2022] I loved this class so much!!!

It is special in that it is one of a kind. There is no other Stanford class that focuses on Hawaii, but professors, not students, need to teach this. The student teachers were slightly organized. A majority of class time was spent with them monologuing. The readings were fantastic, interesting, and not bad in length. I did find myself spending more time on this class than the number of units allows. If Wilcox adopts the class completely as the instructor, I have good faith in it. He allows for discussion, uses presentations to support him while he talks, and challenges us. Be careful when considering this course. It can take up quite a bit of time.", "[0.8] [Spring 2021] This course is an excellent introduction to Native Hawaiian topics and issues, especially a historical overview of the illegal overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom.

As a non-Indigenous student I can say that everyone should take this class--unless you've done the work yourself/have taken a similar class/etc you won't have learned ANY of this in school pre-Stanford. Keoni, Vance, and Mike were all extremely kind, compassionate, and understanding, and really fostered a safe, inclusive, and wholesome class environment.

It's a super welcoming discussion based class. Vance and Keoni are wonderful peer teachers.", "[0.8] [Spring 2021] Go in with an open mind and an open heart!

As a Hawaiian student, I felt really heard and seen by my community by being able to take a class about Hawai'i, but you don't need to be Hawaiian or Indigenous to take this class by any means. I found this class to be a really open and inclusive environment. I didn't remember or understand everything from the class readings, but that's not the point of the class. It's really more so aimed to show people ways of approaching Hawai'i than quizzing people on specific words or dates. I'm really happy I took this class and I'm walking away with a better understanding of a part of my identity I haven't seen represented before.", "[0.8] [Spring 2020] I am so glad I took this class.

It was such a supportive learning environment and the teaching team were so eager to share the material and have us all engage. I learned so much from my Native peers, Hawaiian or otherwise, and truly felt at home, which I don't think many ethnic students can say about the way other courses make them feel. The teaching team's approach to teaching and learning from us, the students, was unmatched compared to other courses and I couldn't recommend this enough to anybody interested in taking it.", "[0.6] [Spring 2020] Definitely take this course! It is a really great way to not only learn about Hawai'i but discuss indigenous issues more broadly, and topics such as feminism and environmentalism. You'll learn a lot for minimal work", "[0.05] [Spring 2020] If this course is offered again please take it, especially if you are an Indigenous student. This course is the work of students who have found that the university does not offer sufficient courses about their history.

And if you've ever gone to Hawai'i for a vacation you should be obligated to take this class.", "[0.55] [Spring 2020] 100% take it.

You spend lots of time in talking circles with your classmates, so you get to know each other and develop strong friendships by the end of the course. You also learn so much about peacemaking, both as a cultural and community-based process of healing, but also as a way to rethink adversarial court systems. One of my favorite parts of the class was exploring the potential role of peacemaking in abolishing police in prisons. The instructors, Karen and Carson, will push you to grow, especially in your essay writing, but they are also very nurturing, kind, and just good mentors and role models to have on campus. When I took the class, it also featured many inspiring guest speakers who are honestly superstars in the peacemaking and/or Native law communities.

You can't learn about mental health and only focus it the colonial way of treatment, in this class you see the various avenues taken and achieved, but also the underlying effects that make it hard for healing for Native people. The class may seem daunting as it is three hours and asks that you do a 20 minute group presentation, but it is not that bad. You aren't sitting and working for the full 3 hours, there are breaks, discussion, and the lecture. The group presentation isn't bad at all either and can be done the way you want. This class gives a lot of insight and can be a bit heavy learning about some parts of Native history, but it is vital if you care about mental health and well-being. Native led classes offer a different space than that of what the colonial education system wants.

Taking this course is one major way in learning how to approach instances in not only Native mental health, but in anything even remotely related to Native peoples and our history.  In order to learn about Native mental health, the context must be explained.  This course does that as well.I feel like I was affirmed in many ways, particular in my experiences growing up.  Finally hearing an in depth explanation of how childhood trauma, and adverse childhood experiences have shaped me and people like me was relieving.  The more I know and understand, the more at ease I feel with me being who I am.  It's affirming in my identity.

Do not take this class if you feel like you don't belong at Stanford with all the \"ethics\" that they tout here while still being extremely unethical... this class will not make your experience here any better. The professor actually said, more than once, that poor people will be the \"lucky\" ones in future generations since they can't afford to have their genes edited. So little time in this class was spent actually thinking about how the decisions made in medicine and science affect society. In fact, for the final paper we were discouraged from tackling \"social\" issues (regarding inequity) because they were too \"easy,\" too \"obvious.\" A lot of time spent blaming the Chinese government for various bioethical mishaps and not enough time spent blaming... I don't know, us? Silicon Valley? Stanford? this class gave me a glimpse into what happens when the very upper crust of society debates \"ethics\"- more often than not, you won't touch on issues that actually matter to 99% of the population.

There are two papers which are fun and actually challenge you to think, and I enjoyed doing the work and the readings.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] This is a fantastic class for anyone deeply interested in the topic of neuroscience and cutting-edge research! Dr. H brings in the brightest minds to his classroom and lets them have very open and honest discussions with us. It is a privilege to learn from this roster of speakers.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] It's an interesting course, but felt more like a lecture series than an actual class. Some of the guest speakers were really good and some less interesting, but it felt more like we were getting a review of research than actually delving deeply into ethical issues.", "[0.05] [Spring 2019] The guest speakers and readings are very interesting. The professor tends to make very uncomfortable and sometimes outright bigoted comments", "[-0.9] [Spring 2019] To be honest, this class was a letdown compared to what was advertised. There were few chances to actually discuss ethics, and more often than not any \"discussion\" was just Dr Hurlbut inserting his own opinion, for which he didn't give much room for disagreement. Do not take this class if you feel like you don't belong at Stanford with all the \"ethics\" that they tout here while still being extremely unethical... this class will not make your experience here any better. The professor actually said, more than once, that poor people will be the \"lucky\" ones in future generations since they can't afford to have their genes edited. So little time in this class was spent actually thinking about how the decisions made in medicine and science affect society. In fact, for the final paper we were discouraged from tackling \"social\" issues (regarding inequity) because they were too \"easy,\" too \"obvious.\" A lot of time spent blaming the Chinese government for various bioethical mishaps and not enough time spent blaming... I don't know, us? Silicon Valley? Stanford? this class gave me a glimpse into what happens when the very upper crust of society debates \"ethics\"- more often than not, you won't touch on issues that actually matter to 99% of the population. I will say, though, for a WAYS-ER class it is very chill- just a couple of papers and attendance. But don't let the rave reviews of this class fool you- if other Stanford classes have ever made you feel vaguely to overtly uncomfortable, this one probably will, too.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] This is an amazing course with incredible guest speakers!

Great class that is not too much work, really makes you think about these issues.", "[0.85] [Spring 2018] I think every single Stanford student should take this class at some point or another. The course really makes you critically think and evaluate what you hold to be true. The workload is totally doable.

TAKE THIS CLASS.", "[0.45] [Spring 2018] one of the most interesting i've ever taken", "[0.85] [Spring 2018] Absolutely take this course! This was my favorite class I have taken at Stanford. Professor Hurlbut brings in the most incredible speakers in the field of neuroscience. This was one of the first classes where I have enthusiastically done the readings for class well before class, and have been disappointed if there is no pre-class work because the topics are just so fascinating.", "[0.55] [Spring 2018] This is the course that made Stanford worth it.

Not to mention, the amazing guest lecturers that you will hear are the leaders of their fields, and the discussions had in this class are incredible and awe-inspiring. Definitely worth the late meeting times!", "[0.9] [Spring 2017] It's not really a class about ethical neuroscience. It's more a chance to get to see famous researchers present on their topics, which was incredibly interesting.

The class is low stress and focused on really learning the material. Its also a super open environment to class discussion and ethical debates. Take it!", "[0.9] [Spring 2017] This class is like the axon hillock of the neuron-- it brings in many people with impressive backgrounds in their respective fields within neuroscience, and puts them all together to send a very effective and poignant action potential of learning to students.", "[0.9] [Spring 2017] Hurlbut and Newsome are both very eloquent, thoughtful people with a lot of complex and fascinating things on their minds.

I would recommend this course if you are a more advanced student looking to polish skills related to this field that you already possess.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] Really great instructor but assumes students know more than they do and goes really fast. Would recommend not taking unless you need to or feel super comfortable coding in python and pytorch. Scott is really nice and helpful though. Unfortunately, the TA's weren't and even admitted at one point that they didn't know what was going on.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] Prof Scott Linderman is one of the best professors I have ever had. I am not into neuroscience. I just thought it would be one of those classes that you only get the chance to take while you are at Stanford. And I am glad I went with my gut on this one. While it was harder than I expected, its made approachable. Similar to other classes such as CS 224n or CS 230 where students complete skeleton code in google Colab notebooks. \n\n\n\nThis skeleton code ends up forming really impressive, new, and cool machine learning models I have not seen elsewhere. While I will not do ANYTHING like what we did in class, so much of what we went over has helped me with modeling time series which will be key to me in my future. \n\n\n\nI would warn students, this should NOT be your first class with machine learning. Take CS 229 first at a minimum. Not only is the math hard, but Scott uses so many packages ranging from pytorch, convexPy (convex python solvers), Tensorflow, and more. If you haven't worked with a machine learning framework before you will be uncomfortable taking this class. But other than that I couldn't reccomend this class more. While the applications were somewhat lackluster (in my opinion) the material will improve you soo much. \n\n\n\nFinally, thanks Scott for this class. I cant believe how smooth it was considering it was the first time it was offered. Maybe consider going alittle easier on lab 7 and 8 for the sanity of future students..  Possibly one of the best classes I have taken at Stanford.", "[0.8] [Winter 2021] This a phenomenal class. One of the most useful classes I've taken in undergrad, for sure! Scott is such a kind and knowledgeable professor. His explanations are incredibly lucid and the colab notebooks are very well put-together. The class can be very difficult for someone with a weak stats/math/coding background, so make sure you have the prerequisites and are able to put time into understanding all the concepts", "[0.9] [Winter 2021] Very good course, I highly recommend taking it with Scott. He's a pleasure and a wealth of knowledge.", "[0.0] [Winter 2021] The class really focuses on the statistics part, including the derivation of the models. The labs will be about the implementation (and sometimes also derivation of extensions of models). Background in neuroscience is not really required.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] Excellent class with fascinating lectures and labs that cover a good deal of ground and cutting-edge techniques. The lectures were phenomenal and overall the class was challenging yet extremely rewarding.", "[1.0] [Winter 2021] Scott has done an impressive job putting together a very rich and organized course. I would recommend taking at least CS229 and maybe both CS229 and CS230 prior to taking this course in order to get the most of it. It is rather refreshing to get to apply sophisticated machine learning algorithms to cases other than the typical computer vision and natural language processing. Also, Scott has one of the best coding styles I have seen. I would recommend going through every Colab notebook line by line, just to learn how to write excellent code! :)", "[0.4] [Winter 2021] This class is fantastic.  The labs alone are a goldmine.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] Highly recommend! The course is extremely well organized. Content in lecture is delivered succinctly and effectively. The labs are outstanding and allow you to learn a significant amount in a very short period of time. Certainly learned a lot!", "[1.0] [Winter 2021] I think Scott was a pretty good lecturer and the content was super interesting. I came from a pure Statistics background so it was pretty tough trying to understand what I was actually trying to achieve building these models because I didn't understand the neuroscience part enough. I guess the prereq/assumption about folks taking this course is that they have at least some prior neuro knowledge, so that's probably why Scott glossed over that a little bit. Also there's a ton of content so it felt like I didn't really have time to understand/digest some of the work, and the math flew over my head really quickly. It's a very tough course content-wise, with both math and the coding, but it's really worth it if you understand it fully. The labs were gold - super helpful to understand what I heard in lecture and actually implement it. The last thing is I also wish we had slightly more time for the final project and remove the last lab, but that's a personal preference.", "[0.6] [Winter 2021] This is a great survey course of recent models and methods that have been used to analyze neural data. Note that the class is team-based, and teams are assigned at random (at least this year).", "[1.0] [Winter 2021] Among the best courses that I have ever taken, period! Learned new & useful concepts every lecture and the weekly labs were interesting and a great way to meet others interested in the field. Scott does a great job presenting the material, so it's okay if you aren't familiar with some of the concepts beforehand, and also makes the course interactive and enjoyable. Very highly recommend.", "[1.0] [Winter 2021] I really enjoyed the class. Scott did a great job making sure it is suitable for people with various backgrounds, not limited to Neuroscience, by encouraging team work.  His lectures were interesting to follow and provided a great overview of statistical modelling in neuroscience.  The course is very well organized, there was never any misunderstanding about the timeline/deadlines/homework feedback. Labs are well written, and you have the flexibility of going as deep into the material as you want to, i.e. you do not need to understand all the little details to complete the labs, however, you can read into the lecture notes and additional materials to master any particular topics you are interested in.  There was no written exam, but the final project.

Dr. Yang is great at lecturing and answering questions, and even in the online format when we couldn't conduct our research experiment in person, she was able to translate it into a month-long, comprehensive group project. Even though we didn't do any experiments as part of the research project, we still were able to learn so much about the research design process, the various steps that go into carrying out an experiment, and how to independently construct a project specifically related to the Tau protein and its role in microtubule stability and neurodegeneration.

I know this issue has been addressed by the MSPA administration and OBGYN department and I hope this can be changed in the future. As a PA student who is very interested in the OBGYN specialty I came to class excited and hungry to learn from very talented and intelligent physicians in my field of interest. When I was not greeted as a student with the same respect as my MD colleagues and was then told I could not participate in some of the hands-on skills, I was very disappointed and discouraged. \n\n\n\nI have made a lot of sacrifices to be able to pay for my education at Stanford. One of the reasons I am willing to make those sacrifices is because Stanford prides themselves on their ability to offer interesting elective courses and access to resources that other programs do not offer. I did not think it was fair or right to be denied access to the resources that should be available to all members of the school of medicine. I have so much respect for the brilliant physicians that I am lucky enough to call my professors and believe that positive interactions between MDs and PAs will lead to a better healthcare system for all of our patients in the future.

She is pretty inclusive of gender and sexual minorities and language as well (or at least tries to be). Her lectures are a little messy, but she brings in so many awesome guest lecturers.

The format changed this year in that students now do presentations on a controversial topic instead of what used to be debates.

You learn a lot.  You gain a new perspective on health as a whole.", "[0.75] [Spring 2019] This class is a lot of work for the number of units that it is.

Mostly it's just a women's reproductive health class, which isn't necessarily bad.", "[0.85] [Spring 2018] The reading responses feel like busy work, but do really help you learn how to read research papers.

Every week was centered around a different topic within pregnancy and the class material was bolstered by the various guest speakers. While the scale of information may seem daunting, Dr. DeTata broke everything down in a way that was easy to understand and implemented interactive activities throughout the quarter.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2022] Take it especially if you do not plan on pursuing any other STEM or BIO courses.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] Take the class. It is most heavy on physiology, but it is very engaging. You will have thoughtful speakers and fun activities and learn so much.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] Super engaging and inspirational! Dr. Detata is a powerful and aspirational teacher and mentor who makes this course irreplacable", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] Take this class!! This class is amazing, you truly feel like you're learning information that not many people have access to. Dr. DeTata is incredible and so knowledgeable, she really loves her job and wants to share it with students! It made me wish I was premed so that I could be an ObGyn!!", "[-0.45] [Autumn 2022] Take it! But have patience for your professor who is also a doctor-- a lot of course material/ assignments are not very well organized", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Dr. DeTata and Dr. Blumstein are incredibly kind professors who care deeply about the well being of their students. The class was a wee bit disorganized but given this was the first undergrad class they have ever taught that was somewhat to be expected, and they did a great job! I learned so much about the various physical, social and scientific elements of pregnancy, I highly suggest the course for anyone who is interested in the topic.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2021] 100% take this class, it was amazingly eye-opening and relevant.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] This course taught me so much about pregnancy that I would have otherwise either never learned or not learned until I have my own kids. There are so many economic, environmental, and political factors that play a huge role in the lives of pregnant people that I was previously unaware of. Also, this course is taught by two of the nicest doctors, both who truly love their jobs as OBGYNs. If you want to take a course on a interesting, very relevant subject I would definitely recommend this class.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] This course is really wonderful! The guest speakers (especially for the classes on the Black maternal mortality crisis, LGBTQ+ family building, and breastfeeding) were truly inspiring and my favorite part of the class. The physiology content and readings at the beginning of the course are a bit dense but are very helpful in understanding the scientific context behind the social/political issues discussed later in the class. Also, the fact that this course is taught by two practicing OBGYNs is so special \u2014 getting to hear them talk about experiences they've had with patients was definitely a highlight of the course.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] I absolutely LOVED this course! Drs. DeTata and Blumstein are amazing, and they truly care about educating their students, preparing them for success, and providing them with the knowledge and skills necessary to create a more equitable future!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] TAKE IT!! Drs Blumstein and DeTata are so understanding and they adjust the course based on your own feedback and what you want to learn about. All of the different speakers that came to class were amazing and you can apply the learnings from this course to any career field. I'm not interested in medicine at all and I highly enjoyed this course and felt that I learned so much.This course was a good break from all other courses and I genuinely enjoyed every single class as every class varied in topic. I genuinely did not expect to love this class as much as I did, and for it being the first time being taught, it was amazing!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] This is an AMAZING class with such caring and engaging professors. Definitely one of my favorite classes at Stanford!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] The instructors are extremely passionate about the topics and are always open to your ideas and thoughts. They also give you great feedback on the essays.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2021] This course was really interesting if you are interested in anything having to do with social justice, medicine, health care, public policy and the law. While the course work was a bit overwhelming at first, the doctors were sure to ask us about how we felt about the workload and adjust accordingly. After the first two weeks or so, homework became very manageable and was a nice mix of documentaries, reading, and writing. The guest speakers that were brought to this class were so inspiring and amazing (they ranged from fertility doctors focused on LGBTQ+ family planning, to doctors working in the NICU to lactation specialists). You also have the privilege of being taught by two amazing OBGYNs which is a real treat because they have so much experience in the field. This class has definitely inspired me to pursue a career that incorporates maternal health and well-being in some way.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2021] You absolutely should take this class! It is so interesting and taught so well. It feels like a little bit more work than a standard introsem, but it is definitely worth it. The information is good to know and you won't encounter another class like this at Stanford. Drs. DeTata and Blumstein are amazing and make the class feel like a family."], "OCEANS 112": [], "OCEANS 114H": [], "OCEANS 12N": ["[0.95] [Autumn 2022] It's a very chill class, Stuart is a great professor and you'll get better at engaging in scientific discussions with your fellow classmates as well as independent research. Just be sure to note you learn a lot through you're conversations with classmates and Stuart, rather than it being taught in a traditional way. It's a fun time and you'll end the class having learned a lot of new things!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] This is a very satisfying course especially because there is so much freedom in what you want to research. Because of the freedom of choice, you learn a lot about what you are interested in. Stuart knows so much about whatever topic you're researching and has a lot of connections. It's worthwhile to take this class even if you have the tiniest bit of interest in marine life.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] It's a really nice way to start learning more about marine biology.

Stuart is such a wonderful professor and human.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2021] This is not a lecture class. This is an collaborative exploration of interests led by students.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Take it!! This class is very interesting and you will definitely learn a lot. There aren't really any lectures so if you're looking to learn lecture-style this isn't the class for you. The presentations were a fun way to make new friends and find people who were passionate about the same niche marine biology topics as me.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] Awesome class! Very self directed so dont expect lecturing. Basically you choose topics you find interesting and research them yourself. As such you get to find out a lot about topics you are interested in. Every few weeks the class will present the projects they have been working on and that is how you learn about topics that you yourself havent been looking into.", "[0.35] [Autumn 2021] Highly recommended class for students who would like to know more about marine biology. However, class is not taught like a typical class, and course requires a lot of independent research.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] A great introductory seminar! Stuart is a kind and extremely knowledgeable professor, committed to helping you succeed in the class and beyond.", "[-0.3] [Autumn 2021] Presentation class with no lectures.

It's really fun, you get to learn a lot and meet lots of people with similar passions, professor Stuart is really helpful and welcoming, has answers to literally any question you could think of and supports his students' passion/interest in the field greatly.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] This class was definitely the most relaxed class I\u2019ve ever taken. There were no lectures, only small group research projects. It was so fun researching and presenting topics that interested me, as well as learning from my peers\u2019 research. However, if you\u2019re looking for classes with structured lectures and direct instruction, this probably isn\u2019t the class for you.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] This class is a fun way to explore marine ecology topics in a low-stress, presentation-based way. There's a lot of flexibility, the Hopkins/Monterey field trip is awesome, and Stuart is a great and knowledgable professor. Know that there's no set curriculum; whatever the groups choose to research is what you'll learn about.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Absolutely take this course if you're interested in marine biology/marine life/exploring the many superpowers of marine animals. You'll learn so much about the fascinating underwater world in a casual, positive learning environment centered on collectively creating a huge common bank of knowledge. Professor Stuart Thompson is also very knowledgeable; he had insights on every single topic we brought up, no matter how obscure.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Absolutely take this class! It is project centered without any lecturing, and Stuart is the best. You do research in small groups and present on topics that your group is interested in. Pretty light load but you still learn cool new information. Stuart is a great resource and almost wish he would lecture more!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] This is a fun class where you get to do research on marine biology topics that interest you. The workload is not too bad, and the field trip to the Hopkins Marine Station and Monterey Bay Aquarium is one you should not miss. In addition to doing your own research with your group, you also get to learn about what everyone else found, which can be very interesting and informative.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2020] The class is less teaching/lecture style than I thought it was going to be; it was more focused on group research projects. That being said, it was still a great class! No stress, Stuart is lovely, and I came out of the class with a lot more knowledge about marine biology than I had going in. Stuart gave us the freedom to research basically whatever we wanted regarding marine animals, and that allowed me to explore what was most interesting to me. Would highly recommend taking if you have interest in marine biology or if you just want to learn a little more about the field.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2020] Awesome course if you want to learn more about marine biology. A basic understanding of biology is assumed, so if you don't have that you might have to do a bit more reading. Course is mostly student-led discussion, so this might not be the right class for you if you want a lecture-based course.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] Awesome course if you are in any way interested in marine bio or animals. Stuart is fantastic willing to help you learn and grow in so many ways. Make sure to put in the work to learn, and stretch yourself in your project ideas!", "[0.6] [Autumn 2020] Very interesting topics with students being able to lead their interests.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] This class is an amazing introduction for anyone considering the field of marine biology, or for anyone who just finds it interesting.

Stuart is such an engaging and kind professor, and he really cares about building your skills, knowledge, and connections in the field.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2020] I would highly recommend this course to any student who is considering taking it. It is fairly laid back but also quite interesting and I learned a lot", "[1.0] [Autumn 2020] This class is super cool! Here's the structure of the course: we as a class decide on an area we'd like to explore; we each do individual research and share what we found interesting the following class; we split into groups based on those more specific interests; we research in depth and create experimental proposals that would further the edge of knowledge on that topic. Super great course for collaborating with peers and lots of freedom to research what you are interested in! Basic understanding of bio and chem will be very helpful (there were not really lectures on sensory systems, more so discussions on specific interesting phenomena).", "[0.3] [Autumn 2020] Approach each topic with a very open mind and a taste for adventure.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2020] A must-take if you love sensory ecology or marine biology. It's self-directed so you have to really be passionate to get a lot out of it", "[0.75] [Autumn 2020] So interesting!! You will improve your collaboration skills, but also your ability to research independently and to ask new questions.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] This course is awesome. Stuart is so enthusiastic about the subject and supportive of the topics we choose to learn about. Discussions about everything we've learned and stories/knowledge Stuart is reminded of are really fun.

You will learn a lot about the marine environment, meet a bunch of people that are also very passionate about marine science, and make good connections with faculty.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] I started off expecting it to be just researching topics and then giving presentations, but suddenly it became the most important class I've ever taken. It showed me I can dive into complicated topics in marine biology despite having no background and come out with a fervent passion for the ocean and a newfound drive to continue researching. If you think you might be into marine bio, take this class. It'll give you your answer. It gave me mine and now I'm planning on going to graduate school for marine biology.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] Stuart is so knowledgeable and genuinely cares about each of his students. The class is very low-stress, but I still feel like I learned a lot and the structure is fairly open-ended so you can research whatever you find most interesting. You also get to take a trip to the Hopkins Marine Lab and Monterey Bay Aquarium!

Stuart is a really nice person who cares, and the work load is light.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2018] it was a great experience, and I recommend taking it!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] A great course with an enthusiastic and fun professor. It's project-based with variable topics, so don't expect a comprehensive introduction to marine biology.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2018] If you're already interested in marine biology and want to get the chance to do some research on topics you are particularly interested in, this is a good class to do that. It's mostly based around group presentations. There is some group discussion and Stuart shares some things he finds interesting, but there isn't much instruction.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] Take it however you can. Professor Thompson is outstanding and his passion for the ocean rubs off on the class. Make sure to legitimately give your effort to the class, as that is far more rewarding than simply coasting through it.", "[0.5] [Autumn 2018] Look into topics that really interest you in the class", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] I would definitely recommend this class to people who are interested in current research on marine biology.

Stuart is so knowledgable and is connected to so many resources. The class is really low-key, but you learn a lot from other students.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2016] Take it! Great class, especially for a first quarter freshman trying to decide what to do.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2016] This course is extremely relaxed and very focused on conversations about various marine topics. The only grading criteria is a paper and frequent presentations, but they are very casual. It's a great class for people uneasy about science courses.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2016] Make sure you know what you're getting into. There was someone in my dorm who thought it would be the instructor lecturing the students, but in actuality, the students are doing the research and the presenting. Stuart guides the conversation and adds in some ideas and feedback. I personally found it super cool, but also kind of disappointing.

Most of the class time was spent on the student presentation and there was almost no teaching from the professor. Three weeks were also taken up by guest lectures or visits from library staff, which was okay. Unfortunately, the professor didn't even have his camera on most of the time, and it made for a very strange learning experience.

You get to learn about so many fascinating marine life strategies while also learning more about science writing.  This has been one of the most interesting and enjoyable bio classes I've taken at Stanford!", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] Take it! Was a wonderful course with the TA Ceyenna and Dr. Palumbi, felt like I learned a lot and the instructors were there to help every step of the way. Definitely a lot of interesting things learned in lectures.", "[0.85] [Spring 2022] This class was really great. I came into this class with an elementary background in evolutionary biology which was not a problem at all. The assignments are different than a traditional biology course but incredibly fun to write.", "[0.85] [Spring 2022] This class covers fascinating material and makes connections between subjects you might not expect. I'd never done science writing before, so this was a great opportunity to learn how to incorporate science into nonfiction and fiction styles. The class is not very organized- the syllabus is confusing, the deadlines are not clear, and I had little idea what some assignments were asking from me. Stick with it, though, and you'll learn so much about marine biology and how to write creatively about fact.", "[0.3] [Spring 2022] This is an absolutely incredible experience, and without a doubt, if you can take it, you should.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] Definitely take this course! This course provides a beautiful look into the science of the life of the sea from an unconventional perspective. It's very much a skills-based course, with the emphasis not on memorization but rather about learning and developing value through the process. The course isn't too much work and Professor Palumbi is very eager to help!", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] I highly recommend this course, I learned so much about marine biology and the ocean. I also got to write some very meaningful pieces and the environment is so respectful. The professor is a fantastic mentor for writing and this really is a captivating course, I highly recommend it no matter your biology background.", "[0.5] [Spring 2021] Read the book. It's very enjoyable. Write outlines for projects.", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] I highly recommend taking this course to learn really interesting scientific facts about extreme life in the sea. We explored some of the fastest fish, flying squids, deep sea creatures, whales, and more. The class is also a great way to express your creativity and write fictional stories about science while incorporating factual information.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] If you have ever considered taking a marine bio class, this is definitely the class to take. The lectures are very interesting and the assignments can be very fun. Dr. Palumbi is a great person.

Prof Palumbi's book is fascinating, would recommend this class to anybody who wants to learn more about marine life and writing science fiction!", "[0.7] [Spring 2021] Combining asynchronous lectures, TA sessions, and live lectures, it's a lot more of a time devotion than most of us initially thought although it is an interesting course", "[0.7] [Spring 2020] This was an exciting course and I learned a lot about marine biology. It is very low intensity and very manageable in general. A great way to check off WAYS-CE. /lit", "[0.05] [Spring 2020] A must take for marine science students/nerds.

The topic is fascinating and its a fun way to explore creative writing!", "[0.9] [Spring 2020] It's super fun!! I loved that we got to do science fiction for the final assignment.", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] Take this course! Professor Palumbi is a fantastic instructor. He is so passionate about sea life and genuinely wants to share what he knows. Also, he adapted his course to the online format the best out of any course I took this quarter. He recorded TED-talk style lectures for students to watch outside of class and made class time very interactive. Take this course!!", "[0.85] [Spring 2020] Super cool topic, but the writing aspect was not what I expected. Less creative writing class and more science writing based on studies and certain formats. Sometimes more work than one would expect out of a 3-unit course.", "[0.5] [Spring 2020] Take it! The teaching staff was amazing and I learned a lot even among terrible circumstances. The class is pretty low stakes and you really get to bring your voice to the table.", "[0.75] [Spring 2020] It's less of a biology class, and more of a writing class focused on biology. Steve's a great lecturer.", "[0.8] [Spring 2019] I really enjoyed this class - it's a very unique blend of scientific information and creative writing that not many other classes on campus offer. Be warned that the marine biology gets quite technical, and lectures are back-to-back, so I would say that you have to be pretty invested in marine biology to get the full return out of the course.", "[0.85] [Spring 2019] Definitely great for someone interested in the intersection between marine biology and science communication.", "[0.9] [Spring 2019] Definitely take this course! I learned so much about science writing and cool marine biology! Plus, Professor Palumbi is amazing! One of my favorite courses at Stanford", "[0.45] [Spring 2019] The lectures are very interesting . Also, do not fall behind in your writing. If you meet the deadlines and write drafts beforehand, the assignments will be very manageable.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] Warning: THERE IS A SECTION FOR THIS COURSE THAT WAS NOT LISTED IN EXPLORE COURSES OR AXESS. This is an excellent class for someone new or currently exploring marine biology / ecology and has a passion or interest in stories. Definitely fun, usually low key, and pretty information rich. My only problem with it was the addition of a section not included on explore courses. We ended up having to schedule these sections and not finalizing them until week 3, meaning I had many course conflicts with the main section.", "[0.85] [Winter 2018] Take this class!!!

A lot of work needs to be done on it. The professors are kind and well meaning but it is a truly astronomical amount of work. Both veterans and newcomers to the subject were displeased by the sheer amount of hours. And despite being a complex subject almost all fundamentals are taught via multiple hours of youtube videos that are barely touched on during in-person instruction. If you have trouble understanding a video, beyond what can be rectified with a question or two, expect to have to go to office hours to address it despite having 8 allotted hours of \"lecture\" a week because their main goal is to jump immediately into application of the videos/labs. To address the overwork it would seem they are considering simply upping the course listing from four to five units to address student distress by being more upfront about the time sink but I don't think that's the real solution. What they need to do to make this class live-able for anyone with a halfway stringent academic schedule is to make some hard decisions about pruning the course to a reasonable amount of content for a quarter. That being said I did learn things I never had before about modeling so if you find yourself wanting to jump in anyway simply make sure the rest of your schedule is low commitment.", "[0.5] [Winter 2022] Don't take this course unless you have a strong foundation in R and Statistical theory", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] A fun class that is challenging but doable for someone not very familiar with the topics.

The class is also much more focused on the theory than you think", "[0.65] [Winter 2022] This is a great class!", "[0.0] [Winter 2021] Youll learn a lot!", "[0.9] [Winter 2021] The course was very casual and a good learning environment. The material is very interesting. However, I wish there were more structure -- something more like a greatest hits of quantitative ecology. It felt like we had a pretty random collection of interesting but disjoint topics.", "[0.4] [Winter 2021] The content was interesting, especially since there were many guest lectures from NOAA and other leading agencies in the domain of marine science who came to share their expertise, but it was often very hard for me to keep up with the technical portions of the course and fully grasp the subject, since there was poor flow in the course content, and there was sometimes a lot of dense materials condensed in a few lectures that I spent hours trying to understand and reading background materials to be able to understand. The course content could have been made more intuitive and structured so as to ensure that students are understanding the material well as the course progresses."], "OCEANS 152": ["[0.95] [Spring 2022] This is a low-key and enjoyable class! Karen is a gem she is so kind, and our TA Noah was also really sweet. Both of them are really approachable.

Karen and Colette are both great and really care about students, and are helpful with answering questions in office hours.", "[0.85] [Spring 2020] It's interesting but if you don't pay attention for a little, it's hard to follow anything after that. It definitely helps to rewatch lectures for the PSETs.", "[0.4] [Spring 2020] Karen is a thoughtful professor, and the lectures are packed with information. This is a high-quality course.", "[0.6] [Spring 2020] Great class to take online if you need to", "[0.35] [Spring 2020] This is a great overview class for anyone thinking about further classes or research in marine chemistry or chemical oceanography; it's not a heavy lift, but you'll learn a ton by attending lectures, doing the readings, and spending time on the psets.", "[0.8] [Spring 2019] This is a very easy course that covers in high level the chemical processes in the ocean regarding CO2 uptake and nutrient cycling. The homework is light and the final exam is easy too. You do have to contribute in four group activities though, even if you take the course credit or no credit.

As someone who's never done any creative writing before, I was kind of nervous going into this class, but Sara is so welcoming and really gives you amazing feedback, as well as opportunities to practice and grow your writing style! Everything about this class, from the readings to the essays to the journal prompts, really helps you learn. I grew so much as a writer and have a newfound appreciation for a field I never explored. A very transformative class for me.", "[1.0] [Winter 2022] No matter what your interests are or background is take this course! My favorite aspect of this class was that each person brought a unique perspective to the group and we were all able to learn from each other. The readings are really interesting and led to great conversations, the journal prompts are fun, and you're flexible to write about honestly anything. Sara does an incredible job at fostering a supportive, positive environment and being new to creative writing I was never intimidated to share in front of my classmates. Highly recommend!", "[0.65] [Winter 2022] TAKE THIS CLASS! it's the best i've ever taken", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Take it! Sara is great and you will learn so much about what creative nonfiction can be. The workload is pretty chill and the field trip is really fun.", "[1.0] [Winter 2022] This course was simply amazing. Weekly discussions around science, creative writing, and the natural world flowed seamlessly and helped me see the world around me and my creative practice in a different light. The class felt like a special break from the craziness of Stanford, engaging with things that really matter and building a class community that cares. Sara's feedback is genuine, kind, and invested. Also, the weekend field trip was truly a special experience, an integral part of the course that allowed us to crystallize our classroom learnings and live the spirit of the course instead of just talking about it.", "[1.0] [Winter 2022] Definitely definitely take this course!!!! Everything about this course experience was fantastic -- the professor is one of the absolute best I have had at Stanford, the class structure was great, and the people in the class helped form a wonderful community. It is a completely manageable amount of work, and I honestly usually found myself looking forward to doing the work that was required. Could not recommend this more highly enough!", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] such a wonderful creative writing course, Sara is amazing!!", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] It is such a unique and wonderful synthesis of ideas, skills, and experiences. It is, if you commit yourself, a truly once-in-a-Stanford class.", "[1.0] [Winter 2022] This is such a marvelous class! Sara is wonderful and the community she fosters in the class is very supportive. I learned a great deal and it was amazing to work with other students who were interested in science and creative writing and so talented. If you are looking for a space for the intersection of science and writing, which is hard to find on campus, this is the place for it. This has been one of the best classes I've taken at Stanford. The field trip to Monterey was also a highlight of the class. You should definitely take this class!", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Take it! It's an incredible time - you get to develop a writing community with people who really care. Even with the field trip to Monterey Bay (whale watching!), I don't think anything was quite as satisfying and fun as just workshopping everyone's pieces and getting to see how people's writing changed and grew over the term. Especially if you feel at the intersection of STEM and humanities, you will find your people here. Even if you don't, you'll discover new ways of seeing whatever side you're coming from and how it relates to communication and science. I walked in not sure if I wanted to write again after a hiatus and walked out with the beginnings of three essays I'm genuinely excited to keep working on.", "[1.0] [Winter 2022] As a senior coming from a STEM-heavy, non-humanities background, this very well might be one of the best courses I've ever taken at Stanford.

I highly recommend it to anyone. I truly loved this class and the things I learned will be useful for the years to come.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] TAKE THIS CLASS 100%! This has been one of my absolute favorite courses at Stanford so far-- even though it was virtual. Sara is such a thoughtful and engaging professor who really invests into her students' work; this made me want to put everything into my work as well. Sara chooses amazing and inspiring readings, and she made all of our workshops very helpful and productive. This was the first writing class I have taken at Stanford and certainly not the last.", "[1.0] [Winter 2021] LOVED this course so much. Definitely recommend taking it. Sara was great and really inspired us and pushed us to be better writers and fostered a great class environment.", "[0.3] [Winter 2021] Sara is an incredible instructor, and this course gives you so much space to stretch yourself to think and be vulnerable outside of your normal realm. The class itself became very close throughout the quarter which is rare in a virtual environment, but Sara facilitated that connection well.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] This was one of my favorite classes I've taken at Stanford so far. Coming from an engineering background, I was initially intimidated about the amount of reading and writing that would be required, but I quickly learned that I could relate to the readings and began to see the power and importance of creative narratives in scientific writing. Sara is such an amazing professor who cares about the development of each student and writer. Her feedback and insights are incredibly valuable, and by the end of the class you are able to develop narratives and pieces that you never thought you could.

In fact, this course will teach you how much those can get in the way of engaging a reader and inviting them to explore a topic with you.", "[0.85] [Winter 2021] This is a really great class for students of any academic background; I learned a lot through the discussions, writing assignments, and assigned readings. It was a really informative and enjoyable ten weeks!", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] It is a very unique interdisciplinary course that brings together the best of creative writing, science and inquiry. You not only go through texts and learn by observation and deconstruction, you also engage in active writing workshops and get hands on experience and live feedback on your work as well. Definitely one of the most unexpected value-add courses I have taken across my degree so far. Sara is a great instructor that keeps the class engaging and flowing!", "[0.85] [Winter 2019] Take it! Take it! Sara is incredible and so inspiring. It will get you more comfortable with your own writing, and you will learn more than you could imagine about yourself.", "[1.0] [Winter 2019] TAKE THIS COURSE! If you love any aspect of writing, reading, or science/nature, this class is for you. Sara is the most lovely, caring, passionate person. She inspired me with the assigned readings and in-class discussions. For Heaven's sake, we went to Monterey Bay and went whale watching. I feel infinitely closer to my fellow students and to my own heart because of this class.", "[1.0] [Winter 2019] This course is so UNIQUE and so so valuable. Creative writing and science have so many intersections, and this class teaches you about how to integrate them in a way that no other Stanford course will. Rather than an emphasis strictly on revision, as many of the more boring PWR-type classes are, this class focuses on ideas and strong writing without judgment and with the feedback of sensitive, helpfully critical peers. You'll learn what you do well and what you could improve upon, plus get to go down awesome rabbit holes on the Internet and use that as research for an essay rather than feeling guilty about doing so. I was excited to do this class's assignments. This is a credit to the amazing instructor. Sara is understanding, caring, takes the time to get to know you, and celebrates your successes right along with you. She's great at organizing, a talented writer, gave us space for genuine, intellectual discussions, and gave great in-class writing prompts. Additionally, the overnight class trip to Hopkins Marine Center and Monterey for whale watching was incredible. We saw not only one whale, but 35 gray whales. Incredible experience, and great for class bonding, escaping the quarter's stress, and taking time to reflect on beautiful things. Take this class please.", "[1.0] [Winter 2019] The passionate and informed instruction in this course is amazing.  If you plan to go into the field of science, or writing, or both, please take this class.  For me it was a way to discover the meeting of my creative and logical sides in a way that honored how both tendencies are devoted to seeking the truth.  It allowed me to rediscover the gravity of good story telling/writing and to find curiosity and excitement in hard sciences once more.", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] This is a wonderful course! Sara is like a writing fairy who will guide you in an epic journey through the intersecting worlds of science and literature. She is so excited about the subject and so supportive. Sometimes the course felt a little rushed and a little disorganized, but we all bonded a ton (and the field trip to Monterey ROCKED). I think as the kinks work out in years to come, this will be one of the best courses at Stanford, hands down.", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] This is a great class! I loved the format, which gave us a lot of room to explore our own styles as writers and to improve on our work in a very friendly and open setting.", "[1.0] [Winter 2019] Sara is amazing. She is so knowledgeable about her craft and will guide you through, ever so gently, the writing process. I hadn't taken any creative writing courses before this one and I'm walking away from it having learned a great deal, produced 3 essays I'm super proud of, and confident to keep reading and writing. The readings we have for the course may, on their own, be worth the price of admission -- there is such an amazing blend of informative/funny/tragic/emotional pieces all of which help communicate some aspect of science. Couldn't overstate how much I recommend this course -- one of my favorites at Stanford!", "[1.0] [Winter 2019] I highly recommend this course. Sara is a fantastic instructor who really cares about her students, puts a lot of thought into providing poignant feedback, and cultivates a fun and inclusive classroom environment. This class also provides a unique opportunity unlike any other at Stanford -- to combine science and creative writing in a meaningful way. As a scientist who has never taken a creative writing class before, I learned about the myriad of ways science can be weaved into creative pieces. Sara encourages you to write about whatever you want, whether that's discussing a scientific idea in an artful manner, or writing a deeply personal essay that is subtly informed by science or nature in some way.  The class also features a field trip to the Marine Hopkins station, which was definitely a highlight of my quarter. We got to go whale watching, visit the aquarium, and write about animals in a relaxed and peaceful getaway. In addition to the three essays, there are also journal prompts that help students practice writing and reflection. Again, highly recommend this amazing opportunity!", "[0.75] [Winter 2019] Take it! This class will go by too quickly. It is completely packed with incredible readings, writing exercises, and prompts. The teacher creates an incredibly comfortable space for students to challenge themselves.

During the land portion, we were in class from 8AM to 5PM (and sometimes later) almost every day with additional assignments and meetings expected on top. More information about the general program can be found at the sea association's website.", "[0.5] [Spring 2022] Stanford at Sea was the hardest thing I have ever done, and one of the most personally revolutionary. I would highly recommend taking this course if you want to discover and push beyond your mental and physical comfort zone. One immensely negatively challenging part of this experience, however, were the obvious tensions between faculty members, who often seemed tensely out of sync with one another in terms of teaching goals and philosophy, and leadership style. While the SEA program's leadership and partnership is invaluable for this program to exist, I felt uncomfortable and sometimes embarrassed at some of the actions the Stanford side brought to the partnership, and undue stress added. Future class cohorts can meaningfully contribute to the better faculty dynamics and partnership dynamics by taking an active role in communicating feedback in real time.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] Stanford@SEA was an absolutely amazing experience. Though challenging at times, it was completely worth it. In the shore component, in Monterey, we got to learn all about oceanography and some of the basics of sailing, as well as some of the history of the islands we visited. We also got to know our staff and each other pretty well before the sea component, which really helped. The sea component was so much better than I expected. We got to visit places I never would've gone to otherwise and interact with the people who live there. We learned about science by doing net tows in the ocean and then analyzing what we found in them. We learned how to sail a tall ship and got closer to each other, becoming a family. I would really recommend applying to this program. It's an incredible experience!", "[0.9] [Spring 2019] I hope you get lucky with awesome TAs and helpful staff beyond the professors because the professors are often hard to approach and connect with beyond just learning the oceanography", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] Stanford@SEA is the happiest I have been in my life!

You'll definitely regret not applying for this program if you're on the fence.", "[0.7] [Spring 2019] This experience will change your life. In the first five weeks you'll have the opportunity to develop your technical knowledge of oceanography which prepares you for the next five weeks of developing technical skills in the middle of the Pacific ocean, putting your life into the hands of the people you will soon call family. If you have any interest in the ocean, you absolutely need to make this part of your Stanford experience.", "[0.7] [Spring 2019] I can&#x2019;t begin to put Stanford at Sea into words. It is radically different than any other class I&#x2019;ve taken. It&#x2019;s hands-on, in situ learning. It is hard work but a bonding experience like no other. It pushed me to create a research project, complete it in a ship, and communicate it. I will keep the lessons from this program with me forever and treasure the memories, photos, and relationships.", "[1.0] [Spring 2019] This class is not for the faint of heart, it takes some grit to deal with sleepless night watches and completing an open ended research project. You will likely sail through storms, the chances of gale force winds are not low and the swells will often knock you over. It&#x2019;s always safe, but the power of the ocean is obvious.   Now if the thought of sailing through a storm is fun, this is probably the perfect program for you. It&#x2019;s not comfortable, but If you can take it, you should take it. It&#x2019;s a transformative experience. I have never been as happy taking a class as I was on this boat. The comfort of looking out towards the ocean and seeing nothing but swells dip below the horizon is unforgettable. The beauty of reef crests on uninhabited atolls reverses any sleepless night. Islanders will welcome you and talk about their life in a way that puts up a mirror to your own life.

The homework assignments and readings will provide some structure for what concepts are important to remember, but just listening to both professors lecture is a true tour de force.", "[0.85] [Spring 2018] Julio and Fio are AMAZING. Don't worry about taking furious notes, just try to follow their logic and storytelling in class and learn whatever you can from them. The day I stopped worrying about taking copious notes is the day I started to learn a lot more from this class. Some of the models are confusing and difficult to understand, but Julio will answer a question a hundred times if that's what you need. The readings are interesting, but not always necessary.

It is an intensive course - consider it a full time activity for 5 weeks. But so rewarding!", "[0.95] [Summer 2022] I would advise anyone considering it to take this course! It's energetically demanding, but you will probably never have another opportunity to be in the water every single day for five weeks straight. Just from being in the field every day, I learned more about diving, methodology, and the local environment than I ever could have from course materials alone. Those first-hand experiences paired with the wealth of knowledge provided by the instructors is what makes this course so valuable. This is easily one of the most informative courses I've ever taken, and the skills and AAUS certification that you gain will prepare you well for a career in marine science.", "[0.45] [Summer 2019] Take the class! By far the most immersive class at Stanford and you'll definitely leave with a renewed understanding of the world underwater!", "[0.95] [Summer 2019] This was one of the most amazing courses I have taken at Stanford! The teaching staff is amazing and the dives are even better. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys diving and learning about marine biology.", "[1.0] [Summer 2019] This course is one of the truly unique learning opportunities at Stanford and should be considered by any ecologist, environmental scientist, biologist, or water-oriented person in general. You will become very comfortable with complex diving tasks and receive a valuable scientific diver certification, gain familiarity with many dozens of marine species and build broader skills to identify different marine phyla, and gain firsthand experience collecting ecological data and identifying species using a scope and keys. I learned a lot about the considerations that must be addressed in designing an ecological study and gathering unbiased data, and about how complex ecosystems function in general. Even though most of my research is terrestrial in nature, these lessons from the marine system apply anywhere.  There isn't really a terrestrial or on-campus analogue to this course, sadly. So if you are interested in ecology or marine biology and have the opportunity to take this class, do it. Robin and everyone else who helps out with the class are all awesome people (shoutout to Freya and Kersten and Jim) and even though the days are long and the water is cold, you'll be stoked to show up to class each morning and give it your all.", "[0.95] [Summer 2019] Hands-down, this was the best learning experience I have had at Stanford. I now know so much more about the natural history of California's sub-tidal kelp forests, a diverse and exceptionally important ecosystem of the Pacific Coast. Kelp forests are important; this class is important.   You do not need to be an expert diver to take the course, but you do need to be open to learning and improving your skills from the first day to the last. In 2019, the course was a full-day commitment, five-days a week, for five weeks. Robin Elahi is a talented professor. You'll learn a lot. And you'll be in good hands with the teaching team and the community at Hopkins.", "[0.75] [Summer 2018] It was one of the most valuable classes of my college career. A must-take class for anyone interested in ecology or field based science. The diving is incredible.", "[0.9] [Summer 2018] This is the best course I have ever taken. Professor Watanabe is remarkable and holds an overwhelming about of knowledge both book and street wise.", "[0.95] [Summer 2018] I loved this course!

This was both the most intense and enjoyable educational experience I've had. I learned a ton about marine biology and ecology, of course, but Jim's general philosophy really rubbed off on me. I feel like he changed the way I look at things as varied as pedagogy, teamwork, and philosophy of science. He is, without a doubt, one of the most knowledgeable teachers I've had and certainly the most engaging. The TA's were also the best TA's I've had in any class. Even though there will be a new lecturer and the course will probably change some, it will still probably be incredible. Expect to work hard, though. Fully taking advantage of this class pretty much requires working all day, studying after class, and getting a lot of sleep every night.", "[1.0] [Summer 2018] It's an amazing class! You'll learn a lot about both kelp forests and ecology in general. Be prepared for a great, but time-intensive experience! The dives you get to go on are incredible, and doing them on your own would cost a lot, so it's a really fabulous opportunity to explore Monterey Bay (for free!!). The TAs and professor really care about sharing their knowledge with you, and want you to have a great time.

Jim is a fantastic lecturer and person, and the class vibe is unlike any other undergraduate class.", "[0.9] [Summer 2017] Amazing course, really recommend it, James Watanabe is one of the best teachers I have ever had, if you read this and can still take it with him get out there now!", "[1.0] [Summer 2017] This is without a doubt one of the best classes offered at Stanford - a remarkable education, an extremely talented and dedicated teacher, and an incomparable place. Kelp Forest Ecology taught me about kelp forest ecology, but it also taught me history, policy, biology, chemistry, and honed my dive skills. It brought together a remarkable and dedicated group of students, and it continues a proud tradition of hands-on, exploratory marine biology education in the Monterey Bay. It is an honor to take this class with Jim Watanabe.", "[0.7] [Summer 2017] Do whatever possible to take this course, especially if your interests lie in studying organisms and their interactions.

A very transformative class for me.", "[1.0] [Winter 2022] No matter what your interests are or background is take this course! My favorite aspect of this class was that each person brought a unique perspective to the group and we were all able to learn from each other. The readings are really interesting and led to great conversations, the journal prompts are fun, and you're flexible to write about honestly anything. Sara does an incredible job at fostering a supportive, positive environment and being new to creative writing I was never intimidated to share in front of my classmates. Highly recommend!", "[0.65] [Winter 2022] TAKE THIS CLASS! it's the best i've ever taken", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Take it! Sara is great and you will learn so much about what creative nonfiction can be. The workload is pretty chill and the field trip is really fun.", "[1.0] [Winter 2022] This course was simply amazing. Weekly discussions around science, creative writing, and the natural world flowed seamlessly and helped me see the world around me and my creative practice in a different light. The class felt like a special break from the craziness of Stanford, engaging with things that really matter and building a class community that cares. Sara's feedback is genuine, kind, and invested. Also, the weekend field trip was truly a special experience, an integral part of the course that allowed us to crystallize our classroom learnings and live the spirit of the course instead of just talking about it.", "[1.0] [Winter 2022] Definitely definitely take this course!!!! Everything about this course experience was fantastic -- the professor is one of the absolute best I have had at Stanford, the class structure was great, and the people in the class helped form a wonderful community.

Could not recommend this more highly enough!", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] such a wonderful creative writing course, Sara is amazing!!", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] It is such a unique and wonderful synthesis of ideas, skills, and experiences. It is, if you commit yourself, a truly once-in-a-Stanford class.", "[1.0] [Winter 2022] This is such a marvelous class! Sara is wonderful and the community she fosters in the class is very supportive. I learned a great deal and it was amazing to work with other students who were interested in science and creative writing and so talented. If you are looking for a space for the intersection of science and writing, which is hard to find on campus, this is the place for it. This has been one of the best classes I've taken at Stanford. The field trip to Monterey was also a highlight of the class. You should definitely take this class!", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Take it! It's an incredible time - you get to develop a writing community with people who really care. Even with the field trip to Monterey Bay (whale watching!), I don't think anything was quite as satisfying and fun as just workshopping everyone's pieces and getting to see how people's writing changed and grew over the term. Especially if you feel at the intersection of STEM and humanities, you will find your people here. Even if you don't, you'll discover new ways of seeing whatever side you're coming from and how it relates to communication and science. I walked in not sure if I wanted to write again after a hiatus and walked out with the beginnings of three essays I'm genuinely excited to keep working on.", "[1.0] [Winter 2022] As a senior coming from a STEM-heavy, non-humanities background, this very well might be one of the best courses I've ever taken at Stanford. Sara is fantastic and allows you to explore creative nonfiction writing in a relaxed, approachable, and fascinating manner. The readings were amazing and have stuck with me, as did the workshops and discussions. Definitely take this class - it's a very low stress way to explore a very fascinating subject!!!", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] Please take it. Hands down, if you are STEM, humanities, whatever, Sara is one of the most amazing instructors I have ever met at Stanford, and her love and care for her students and the subject is unparalleled. If I could take this class again, I totally would.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] This course is excellent. Sara is an excellent professor who really goes out of her way to help students. I highly recommend it to anyone. I truly loved this class and the things I learned will be useful for the years to come.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] TAKE THIS CLASS 100%! This has been one of my absolute favorite courses at Stanford so far-- even though it was virtual. Sara is such a thoughtful and engaging professor who really invests into her students' work; this made me want to put everything into my work as well. Sara chooses amazing and inspiring readings, and she made all of our workshops very helpful and productive. This was the first writing class I have taken at Stanford and certainly not the last.", "[1.0] [Winter 2021] LOVED this course so much. Definitely recommend taking it. Sara was great and really inspired us and pushed us to be better writers and fostered a great class environment.", "[0.3] [Winter 2021] Sara is an incredible instructor, and this course gives you so much space to stretch yourself to think and be vulnerable outside of your normal realm. The class itself became very close throughout the quarter which is rare in a virtual environment, but Sara facilitated that connection well.", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] This was one of my favorite classes I've taken at Stanford so far. Coming from an engineering background, I was initially intimidated about the amount of reading and writing that would be required, but I quickly learned that I could relate to the readings and began to see the power and importance of creative narratives in scientific writing. Sara is such an amazing professor who cares about the development of each student and writer. Her feedback and insights are incredibly valuable, and by the end of the class you are able to develop narratives and pieces that you never thought you could. Absolutely take this class!", "[0.85] [Winter 2021] Great course with awesome readings and discussions. Lots of room for writers of all skill levels to grow.", "[0.75] [Winter 2021] This course will give you the tools and practice to become a credible and powerful writer on any topic. It reveals that you don't have to be an expert, use jargon or limit yourself to technical communication. In fact, this course will teach you how much those can get in the way of engaging a reader and inviting them to explore a topic with you.", "[0.85] [Winter 2021] This is a really great class for students of any academic background; I learned a lot through the discussions, writing assignments, and assigned readings. It was a really informative and enjoyable ten weeks!", "[0.95] [Winter 2021] It is a very unique interdisciplinary course that brings together the best of creative writing, science and inquiry. You not only go through texts and learn by observation and deconstruction, you also engage in active writing workshops and get hands on experience and live feedback on your work as well. Definitely one of the most unexpected value-add courses I have taken across my degree so far. Sara is a great instructor that keeps the class engaging and flowing!", "[0.85] [Winter 2019] Take it! Take it! Sara is incredible and so inspiring. It will get you more comfortable with your own writing, and you will learn more than you could imagine about yourself.", "[1.0] [Winter 2019] TAKE THIS COURSE! If you love any aspect of writing, reading, or science/nature, this class is for you. Sara is the most lovely, caring, passionate person. She inspired me with the assigned readings and in-class discussions. For Heaven's sake, we went to Monterey Bay and went whale watching. I feel infinitely closer to my fellow students and to my own heart because of this class.", "[1.0] [Winter 2019] This course is so UNIQUE and so so valuable. Creative writing and science have so many intersections, and this class teaches you about how to integrate them in a way that no other Stanford course will. Rather than an emphasis strictly on revision, as many of the more boring PWR-type classes are, this class focuses on ideas and strong writing without judgment and with the feedback of sensitive, helpfully critical peers. You'll learn what you do well and what you could improve upon, plus get to go down awesome rabbit holes on the Internet and use that as research for an essay rather than feeling guilty about doing so. I was excited to do this class's assignments. This is a credit to the amazing instructor. Sara is understanding, caring, takes the time to get to know you, and celebrates your successes right along with you. She's great at organizing, a talented writer, gave us space for genuine, intellectual discussions, and gave great in-class writing prompts. Additionally, the overnight class trip to Hopkins Marine Center and Monterey for whale watching was incredible. We saw not only one whale, but 35 gray whales. Incredible experience, and great for class bonding, escaping the quarter's stress, and taking time to reflect on beautiful things. Take this class please.", "[1.0] [Winter 2019] The passionate and informed instruction in this course is amazing.  If you plan to go into the field of science, or writing, or both, please take this class.  For me it was a way to discover the meeting of my creative and logical sides in a way that honored how both tendencies are devoted to seeking the truth.  It allowed me to rediscover the gravity of good story telling/writing and to find curiosity and excitement in hard sciences once more.", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] This is a wonderful course! Sara is like a writing fairy who will guide you in an epic journey through the intersecting worlds of science and literature. She is so excited about the subject and so supportive. Sometimes the course felt a little rushed and a little disorganized, but we all bonded a ton (and the field trip to Monterey ROCKED). I think as the kinks work out in years to come, this will be one of the best courses at Stanford, hands down.", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] This is a great class! I loved the format, which gave us a lot of room to explore our own styles as writers and to improve on our work in a very friendly and open setting.", "[1.0] [Winter 2019] Sara is amazing. She is so knowledgeable about her craft and will guide you through, ever so gently, the writing process. I hadn't taken any creative writing courses before this one and I'm walking away from it having learned a great deal, produced 3 essays I'm super proud of, and confident to keep reading and writing. The readings we have for the course may, on their own, be worth the price of admission -- there is such an amazing blend of informative/funny/tragic/emotional pieces all of which help communicate some aspect of science. Couldn't overstate how much I recommend this course -- one of my favorites at Stanford!", "[1.0] [Winter 2019] I highly recommend this course. Sara is a fantastic instructor who really cares about her students, puts a lot of thought into providing poignant feedback, and cultivates a fun and inclusive classroom environment. This class also provides a unique opportunity unlike any other at Stanford -- to combine science and creative writing in a meaningful way. As a scientist who has never taken a creative writing class before, I learned about the myriad of ways science can be weaved into creative pieces. Sara encourages you to write about whatever you want, whether that's discussing a scientific idea in an artful manner, or writing a deeply personal essay that is subtly informed by science or nature in some way.  The class also features a field trip to the Marine Hopkins station, which was definitely a highlight of my quarter. We got to go whale watching, visit the aquarium, and write about animals in a relaxed and peaceful getaway. In addition to the three essays, there are also journal prompts that help students practice writing and reflection. Again, highly recommend this amazing opportunity!", "[0.75] [Winter 2019] Take it! This class will go by too quickly. It is completely packed with incredible readings, writing exercises, and prompts. The teacher creates an incredibly comfortable space for students to challenge themselves.

This course provides both the foundation to understand the basics, but also the discussions and freedom to explore more complex topics.", "[0.85] [Winter 2018] The handouts are excellent and the lectures are largely based on the text presented in these handouts. The lectures highlights the major differences between phyla that you then are able to group animals collected into distinct phyla/class/orders. Lab is fun and stimulating, and the instructor knows a lot about marine animals.", "[0.9] [Winter 2018] This course is not to be missed if you want to study evolutionary biology or ecology, especially of invertebrates or marine organisms.

Oliver is very helpful with debugging. It's VERY tough, but you'll learn a lot.", "[1.0] [Spring 2022] Oliver is extremely knowledgeable about coastal ocean modeling. However, the course is described as 3 courses merged into one and as a result, is extremely fast-paced. Be prepared to devote a significant amount of time for the class (>20 hrs/week). I often felt extremely overwhelmed by assignments and course content. If you decide to take the class and feel overwhelmed and stressed, I recommend talking to the TA or professor. They're there to support you. Your classmates are also one of your greatest resources. Collaborate on assignments! It is highly unlikely you will be able to succeed by yourself. It is the hardest class I've taken at Stanford, but I feel that I learned a lot. Assignments are heavily MATLAB-based, so having a strong MATLAB background will save you time on assignments. I would recommend this class only to those who are genuinely interested in the course content. Otherwise, the stress and workload may make the class less enjoyable.", "[0.55] [Spring 2022] This is a hard and time consuming course, but there is a lot of support from the TA, professor, and the other students in the class.

Much of the assignments are coding, so if you are experienced with Matlab you are in a little better place to start. Often necessary to go to office hours/TA session to understand the assignments once they are assigned, and can expect to spend a long time on the assignments and debugging code.

An amazing opportunity to meet many different types of talented, mind-blowing people doing powerful work in conservation.", "[0.35] [Spring 2018] It's a great class, but you really get out of it what you put in. Read the papers before the seminar to get the most from what the presenter is talking about.", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] Larry's so kind & knowledgeable, and he loves to talk about marine science or just about life. The class was entirely based on 6 hours of class/week, usually 3 of lecture, a 1 hour guest seminar, and a 2 hour discussion with the guest speaker. We had to do 1 blog post on a guest speaker, 1 final reflection paper, and a creative project. We also took awesome field trips to a sea lion sanctuary, MBARI, and whale-watching. Super cool class in a subject I would've learned nothing about otherwise.", "[0.85] [Spring 2018] You have the opportunity to meet and talk to incredible speakers from all backgrounds. Use this opportunity! Don't waste it!", "[0.7] [Spring 2018] Definitely take it! You'll hear from lots of interesting people about lots of different topics on marine conservation.", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] This class is super awesome to learn about conservation and a safe space to try a different side of science (With the video project). The project is a lot of fun and you get the opportunity to meet some cool people and see some cool places. Would recommend. Just know that it will be a lot of hours towards the end.", "[0.8] [Spring 2017] The guest lecturers are amazing, and take advantage of the unique opportunity to ask them questions and have lunch with them.", "[0.85] [Spring 2017] This course is great for anyone who is getting exposure to a lot of different ways to engage with conservation. The Friday lecture series was the most beneficial part of the course."], "OCEANS 274": ["[0.5] [Summer 2018] It is a fun course, the intensive nature really allows you to focus on why microbes are what they are."], "OCEANS 274H": ["[-0.1] [Spring 2022] Most useful class i've taken in the three years I've been at Stanford. R is super helpful for ecology but can be used in many different fields. Also, Big Rob is the goat of stanford instructors.", "[0.9] [Spring 2022] This class is a great introduction into statistical analyses and R, plus it fulfills the Biology stats requirement. Robin is an awesome professor and if you have to take stats, take it with him.", "[-0.5] [Spring 2019] Take this class but be aggressive about asking for help. Many people scrambled to do the p-sets without ever communicating the issues with the instructors.   Also, we need to see our quizzes and homeworks. That's how I learn. Through mistakes. I think you can literally have assignmnets where you have to redo the problems you get wrong and that would teach people more stats. With R, stats totally got overlooked. I think quiz corrections would be great.", "[0.75] [Spring 2019] Make sure to do the readings and pay attention in lecture. Doing both helps you absorb the material better.", "[0.85] [Spring 2019] R is important, get through it, you will be happy having learned it in the end. Go to office hours to work out the kinks in what you don't understand. Do not be intimidated do not fail to ask questions cause you feel uninformed.", "[0.45] [Spring 2019] Ask lots of questions and go to office hours for extra support!", "[0.6] [Spring 2019] This is a great class for understanding why, when and how to use different statistical tests", "[0.8] [Spring 2019] Very informative and insightful course. I learned so much about experimental design and statistics, and I now feel that I really understand all of the hard statistical concepts that I've been taught in the past but never fully understood. There is also a lot of R involved, but I thought that this really helped me understand the stats better while also making me a lot better at coding.", "[0.6] [Spring 2019] If you haven't taken stats before, this is a great introduction.", "[0.55] [Spring 2019] Go to office hours, and prepare for quizzes by focusing on broad concepts rather than equations. The homeworks are unpredictable in terms of time and difficulty, so be sure to start well ahead of time to see what to expect each week. The professor does not always respond well to questions in the middle of class on the spot, so might be helpful to gather your questions and prepare them for office hours or after class.", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] Super useful, great class. A lot of work but you know it's for a good reason and the stuff you're learning is actually super important and I'll probably need when I begin to do my own research", "[0.6] [Spring 2018] This course was fantastic!", "[0.85] [Spring 2018] If you want to learn biostatistics, this course is amazing. This is Jim's last year though, so it might be different next year. Great introduction to ANOVA.", "[0.85] [Spring 2018] I am so sad Jim is retiring!!! He is an excellent professor and this has been one of the best-taught classes that I've ever taken. As someone who feels extremely incompetent in both my math and computing skills, I was blown away by how much I was able to do at the end of the quarter, and it was all due to Jim's excellent teaching. I hope that his replacement will be as great as he was.", "[0.35] [Spring 2018] I would highly recommend this class to any future scientist. I couldn't imagine any other class being able to teach statistics in such a comprehensive and applicable manner. I not only understood how to preform statistical tests, but how each set could be applied to a different type of experimental question or design.", "[0.7] [Spring 2018] This class was the bomb. I hate math and statistics, but Jim is an incredible prof (retiring summer 2018, unfortunately) who made the class as easy as possible.", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] Jim is an absolute gem. He is, truly, one of the best professors I have ever had. While I hope he has an incredible retirement, Hopkins is going to miss him dearly, and the next professor to teach the class has huge shoes to fill.", "[0.9] [Spring 2017] Psets are hard but useful. Use the packets and others when doing the psets. Lectures are a little rough, but if you ever don't understand something go ask Jim. He is more than happy to answer the same question a million times if that's what you need.", "[0.0] [Spring 2017] Keep all of the worksheets. Go to office hours.", "[0.6] [Spring 2017] Jim does a great and thorough job going over the basics of ANOVA's, which is most of the material covered in the class.", "[0.7] [Spring 2017] Very helpful for anyone interested in regularly using statistics or R.", "[-0.05] [Spring 2017] Stay on top of stuff, learn R before the final and really don't be afraid to have a chat with Jim about anything unclear."], "OCEANS 275": ["[0.55] [Winter 2022] I learned more in this class than any other seminar. Definitely worth the time.", "[0.45] [Winter 2018] This is a good course if you study the nitrogen cycle in aquatic ecosystems. It forces you to actually read the book on nitrogen in the marine environment. And there is discussion with your peers on updates since the book was published.", "[0.8] [Winter 2018] A great overview of the marine nitrogen cycle! Especially useful for staying updated on recent developments in the field."], "OCEANS 285H": ["[0.95] [Summer 2022] I would highly recommend this course. Not only is it highly educational and the AAUS certification is super valuable, but it's ridiculously fun as well. Be prepared to put in a lot of hours in and outside the classroom. It is an intensive course - consider it a full time activity for 5 weeks. But so rewarding!", "[0.95] [Summer 2022] I would advise anyone considering it to take this course! It's energetically demanding, but you will probably never have another opportunity to be in the water every single day for five weeks straight. Just from being in the field every day, I learned more about diving, methodology, and the local environment than I ever could have from course materials alone. Those first-hand experiences paired with the wealth of knowledge provided by the instructors is what makes this course so valuable. This is easily one of the most informative courses I've ever taken, and the skills and AAUS certification that you gain will prepare you well for a career in marine science.", "[0.45] [Summer 2019] Take the class! By far the most immersive class at Stanford and you'll definitely leave with a renewed understanding of the world underwater!", "[0.95] [Summer 2019] This was one of the most amazing courses I have taken at Stanford! The teaching staff is amazing and the dives are even better. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys diving and learning about marine biology.", "[1.0] [Summer 2019] This course is one of the truly unique learning opportunities at Stanford and should be considered by any ecologist, environmental scientist, biologist, or water-oriented person in general. You will become very comfortable with complex diving tasks and receive a valuable scientific diver certification, gain familiarity with many dozens of marine species and build broader skills to identify different marine phyla, and gain firsthand experience collecting ecological data and identifying species using a scope and keys. I learned a lot about the considerations that must be addressed in designing an ecological study and gathering unbiased data, and about how complex ecosystems function in general. Even though most of my research is terrestrial in nature, these lessons from the marine system apply anywhere.  There isn't really a terrestrial or on-campus analogue to this course, sadly. So if you are interested in ecology or marine biology and have the opportunity to take this class, do it. Robin and everyone else who helps out with the class are all awesome people (shoutout to Freya and Kersten and Jim) and even though the days are long and the water is cold, you'll be stoked to show up to class each morning and give it your all.", "[0.95] [Summer 2019] Hands-down, this was the best learning experience I have had at Stanford. I now know so much more about the natural history of California's sub-tidal kelp forests, a diverse and exceptionally important ecosystem of the Pacific Coast. Kelp forests are important; this class is important.   You do not need to be an expert diver to take the course, but you do need to be open to learning and improving your skills from the first day to the last. In 2019, the course was a full-day commitment, five-days a week, for five weeks. Robin Elahi is a talented professor. You'll learn a lot. And you'll be in good hands with the teaching team and the community at Hopkins.", "[0.75] [Summer 2018] It was one of the most valuable classes of my college career. A must-take class for anyone interested in ecology or field based science. The diving is incredible.", "[0.9] [Summer 2018] This is the best course I have ever taken. Professor Watanabe is remarkable and holds an overwhelming about of knowledge both book and street wise.", "[0.95] [Summer 2018] I loved this course! It is a bit of work to complete all of the readings and memorization for the exams but in my experience it is full of super interesting people and covers a subject that is very diverse and fascinating to learn about!", "[1.0] [Summer 2018] By far the best course I have taken at Stanford. This was both the most intense and enjoyable educational experience I've had. I learned a ton about marine biology and ecology, of course, but Jim's general philosophy really rubbed off on me. I feel like he changed the way I look at things as varied as pedagogy, teamwork, and philosophy of science. He is, without a doubt, one of the most knowledgeable teachers I've had and certainly the most engaging. The TA's were also the best TA's I've had in any class. Even though there will be a new lecturer and the course will probably change some, it will still probably be incredible. Expect to work hard, though. Fully taking advantage of this class pretty much requires working all day, studying after class, and getting a lot of sleep every night.", "[1.0] [Summer 2018] It's an amazing class! You'll learn a lot about both kelp forests and ecology in general. Be prepared for a great, but time-intensive experience! The dives you get to go on are incredible, and doing them on your own would cost a lot, so it's a really fabulous opportunity to explore Monterey Bay (for free!!). The TAs and professor really care about sharing their knowledge with you, and want you to have a great time. Best class I've taken at Stanford!!", "[0.7] [Summer 2017] I wouldn't hesitate to sign up for this course, it is by far the best course I have taken during my entire degree.", "[0.95] [Summer 2017] You definitely have to commit to this course because it takes a lot out of you, but this is easily one of the best courses and experiences at Stanford. Jim is a fantastic lecturer and person, and the class vibe is unlike any other undergraduate class.", "[0.9] [Summer 2017] Amazing course, really recommend it, James Watanabe is one of the best teachers I have ever had, if you read this and can still take it with him get out there now!", "[1.0] [Summer 2017] This is without a doubt one of the best classes offered at Stanford - a remarkable education, an extremely talented and dedicated teacher, and an incomparable place. Kelp Forest Ecology taught me about kelp forest ecology, but it also taught me history, policy, biology, chemistry, and honed my dive skills. It brought together a remarkable and dedicated group of students, and it continues a proud tradition of hands-on, exploratory marine biology education in the Monterey Bay. It is an honor to take this class with Jim Watanabe.", "[0.7] [Summer 2017] Do whatever possible to take this course, especially if your interests lie in studying organisms and their interactions.

Highly recommend.", "[0.5] [Autumn 2018] The course isn't very structured (since it's a lecture series), and many of the lectures end up trying to cover more material than they have time for, or go deeper into it than is easily understandable. However, it was still a fair overview of different types of research and jobs available in the field of marine biology. The quality of the lectures was highly dependent on the lecturer, so some of them were really good (especially Bill Gilly's lecture on squid) and some were fairly uninteresting or rushed.

I'd recommend anyone take it, even if you're like me and not majoring in biology, just have an interest in marine bio. Personally, the lectures about fishing, climate change, etc. didn't interest me as much as the ones about actual organisms, like the evolution of sensory systems or the color-changing mechanisms in squid or how whales filter feed.

Worth it in retrospect though.", "[0.55] [Spring 2022] Stanford at sea is a crazy experience. It is most definitely not for everyone. This will likely be one of the most challenging things you ever experience. Between the watch schedule (2 6-hour watches within a 24 hour period) and just being so far from home, stanford at sea is not for the faint of heart.

More information about the general program can be found at the sea association's website.", "[0.5] [Spring 2022] Stanford at Sea was the hardest thing I have ever done, and one of the most personally revolutionary. I would highly recommend taking this course if you want to discover and push beyond your mental and physical comfort zone. One immensely negatively challenging part of this experience, however, were the obvious tensions between faculty members, who often seemed tensely out of sync with one another in terms of teaching goals and philosophy, and leadership style. While the SEA program's leadership and partnership is invaluable for this program to exist, I felt uncomfortable and sometimes embarrassed at some of the actions the Stanford side brought to the partnership, and undue stress added. Future class cohorts can meaningfully contribute to the better faculty dynamics and partnership dynamics by taking an active role in communicating feedback in real time.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] Stanford@SEA was an absolutely amazing experience. Though challenging at times, it was completely worth it. In the shore component, in Monterey, we got to learn all about oceanography and some of the basics of sailing, as well as some of the history of the islands we visited. We also got to know our staff and each other pretty well before the sea component, which really helped. The sea component was so much better than I expected. We got to visit places I never would've gone to otherwise and interact with the people who live there. We learned about science by doing net tows in the ocean and then analyzing what we found in them. We learned how to sail a tall ship and got closer to each other, becoming a family. I would really recommend applying to this program. It's an incredible experience!", "[0.9] [Spring 2019] I hope you get lucky with awesome TAs and helpful staff beyond the professors because the professors are often hard to approach and connect with beyond just learning the oceanography", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] Stanford@SEA is the happiest I have been in my life! The people and the course are all amazing and this is a once in a lifetime opportunity! Anyone who is interested in the ocean or sailing in any capacity should absolutely take this course!", "[0.25] [Spring 2019] Talk to someone who's taken the class before -- it can't be done justice with carta reviews. Most incredible abroad program I could imagine. Amazing learning inside and outside the classroom, learned so much about oceanography, sailing, and myself. You'll definitely regret not applying for this program if you're on the fence.", "[0.7] [Spring 2019] This experience will change your life. In the first five weeks you'll have the opportunity to develop your technical knowledge of oceanography which prepares you for the next five weeks of developing technical skills in the middle of the Pacific ocean, putting your life into the hands of the people you will soon call family. If you have any interest in the ocean, you absolutely need to make this part of your Stanford experience.", "[0.7] [Spring 2019] I can&#x2019;t begin to put Stanford at Sea into words. It is radically different than any other class I&#x2019;ve taken. It&#x2019;s hands-on, in situ learning. It is hard work but a bonding experience like no other. It pushed me to create a research project, complete it in a ship, and communicate it. I will keep the lessons from this program with me forever and treasure the memories, photos, and relationships.", "[1.0] [Spring 2019] This class is not for the faint of heart, it takes some grit to deal with sleepless night watches and completing an open ended research project. You will likely sail through storms, the chances of gale force winds are not low and the swells will often knock you over. It&#x2019;s always safe, but the power of the ocean is obvious.   Now if the thought of sailing through a storm is fun, this is probably the perfect program for you. It&#x2019;s not comfortable, but If you can take it, you should take it. It&#x2019;s a transformative experience. I have never been as happy taking a class as I was on this boat. The comfort of looking out towards the ocean and seeing nothing but swells dip below the horizon is unforgettable. The beauty of reef crests on uninhabited atolls reverses any sleepless night. Islanders will welcome you and talk about their life in a way that puts up a mirror to your own life. You will form a crew wonderful community with the crew and shipmates."], "OCEANS 330": ["[0.35] [Autumn 2022] You will get out of this course what you put in. The more time you spend understanding the readings, coming up with questions, and engaging with your peers during class, the more you will get out of the course."], "OCEANS 350H": ["[0.35] [Summer 2021] There aren't any other courses like this at Stanford that give such a broad view an animal diversity and development.", "[0.45] [Summer 2021] Definitely take this course! I learned more than in the Dev Bio 210 course."], "OCEANS 47H": ["[0.9] [Spring 2022] Big Rob is one of the best instructors at Stanford and you'll learn a ton. Super laid back but effective at engaging the class and getting things done.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] This is an awesome course, you'll learn so much about intertidal ecology, intertidal zoology, and scientific writing. Robin is an extremely passionate and caring professor who makes sure that everyone is excited by the things they learn and that they personally understand each concept. The only thing that might hold back some people from taking this course is the cumulative research paper on a topic of your choosing, since this course satisfies WIM. At first I was stressed that I couldn't find a topic to write about but eventually I came across a cool discovery in the data we analyzed and was able to form my paper around that. Overall, I highly recommend this course or taking any course with Robin!", "[0.65] [Summer 2021] There is a lot of content in the course but it is very helpful for students wanting to go into research.", "[0.95] [Summer 2021] I learned so much (probably the most compared to any other class I've taken in the last 3 years). I definitely learned a lot of applicable scientific thinking and writing skills. Focus is on coming up with a final project and executing it using R and statistical analysis. We learned about tidal physics and rocky shores. I would recommend it! It is beginner-friendly, and Robin is super understanding and supportive. Office hours were also always very useful.", "[0.65] [Summer 2021] I would recommend this course to any student interested in Biology, as it covers research topics that are applicable to any field, such as finding appropriate resources, analyzing data, research methodologies, and scientific writing.", "[0.95] [Summer 2021] Great class to take with Profs Elahi and Denny. You don't need a very strong background in programming and analysis as profs and tas are really good about help you.", "[0.6] [Spring 2019] Take this class... The first five weeks are great. The last five are meh. But it's worth taking.", "[0.9] [Spring 2019] Really fun class if you choose a project you like. However, the second half of the class doesn't take advantage of the tidepools and marine station location. The first half is awesome in that respect.", "[-0.05] [Spring 2019] This class can be a bit difficult because you need to decide on a research project to undertake and it is not very clear in the beginning, how important it is to plan ahead and really think about project feasibility. It however provides good experience in thinking about the different parts that come together to form an experimental study.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] Definitely one of my favorite courses at Hopkins. The opportunity to spend so much time developing my own research project, and actually going out into the field every week to collect my own data was an awesome experience. Definitely recommend to anyone who wants to explore the intertidal in a fun and academic way.", "[-0.25] [Spring 2019] Start your drafts early, and talk to each instructor about their specific feedback, otherwise sometimes it seems they don&#x2019;t read each other&#x2019;s feedback and it can get confusing.", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] it's a wild ride, lots of information and a steep learning curve when you begin writing your proposal (there's not a lot of guidance, the feedback from professors is helpful but you go through ~8 or 9 drafts) super important and valuable class though, I learned a ton", "[0.0] [Spring 2018] Take the course. You will learn so much", "[0.8] [Spring 2018] This course is really challenging, but it is totally worth it. Some early morning tide pooling is difficult, but Jim and Mark are super encouraging. Get started working on introductions early, because most of the difficult writing and editing comes at the end.", "[0.9] [Spring 2018] Excellent class! I went into this class absolutely terrified of doing fieldwork in the intertidal - I made my TA stay behind with me while I slowly crawled along the rocks - and by the end of it I was confidently going out on a regular basis to do fieldwork for a study that I designed on a topic that I was passionate about. This class fosters tremendous growth in both experimental planning and writing. Wish I could do it all over again!", "[0.9] [Spring 2018] Of all of the courses at Hopkins, this is the one that will teach you the most about the intertidal. I got to know the species and community of the intertidal very well. I took this course the first year it was in the Bio Core as an Earth Systems student, and so it was a little unorganized. You will have to be up very early for this class every other week. Be prepared to be out in the intertidal for hours early in the morning, and to get a little soggy. Choose a project you find interesting in the beginning or it will be difficult to motivate yourself to do your own research. We only had to write one paper this quarter, which is a pretty good deal for a Writing in the Major course, though you start that paper pretty late in the quarter and it piles up very quickly and frustratingly towards the end. You will have a paper due in three parts, but you will be getting edits for all three on a rolling basis. Ask the professors for an example paper in the beginning, that would have helped me. Think about statistics for your data from the beginning. Enjoy becoming a morning person and learn everything you can about the intertidal organisms.", "[0.7] [Spring 2018] This class was definitely a lot of work, and a number of early mornings, but there's nothing like learning about the intertidal from experts, or learning how to create an experiment from people who've done it hundreds of times. This was the first time I've really felt like a scientist.", "[0.9] [Spring 2018] Such an amazing way to fulfill your writing in the major requirement, and even if you don't need that fulfilled it's fun. Getting to learn from the professors, especially this being Jim's last spring teaching, was a gift.", "[0.4] [Spring 2017] Ask for a ton of help on the lab reports. They're more than willing to tell you exactly what they're looking for", "[0.4] [Spring 2017] ask professors for help on lab papers", "[0.85] [Spring 2017] In this class, I was able to go snorkeling, tidepooling, and learn a lot about marine organisms. The lab pairs well with Biocore, but I'm not sure if it will be changed to match the new Biology Foundation courses. Some of the students who were not in this class were invited to join us for certain labs, so that other students can experience snorkeling and tidepooling even if they aren't in this lab class. The professors are very helpful in providing corrections to lab reports."], "OCEANS 6N": ["[0.9] [Winter 2022] You should take this course if you are particularly passionate about marine conservation and biology, or just in general want to take part in creating solutions for a better more environmentally friendly world.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] I highly reccomend this course to any students interested in ocean conservation. You don't have to be on a biology or science track to benefit from it (for reference, I'm an English major). The course offers a great opportunity for collaboration and learning about the ocean and its fragile ecosystems.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] Dr. Crowder is a great teacher who has many great anecdotes and stories that relate to the content that greatly enhance the experience", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] The coursework is pretty light. We are provided a case study every class session and discuss solutions in small groups + present for two rounds, with some comments from Larry. I originally thought such long class periods dedicated to discussing would be scary, but it was actually great and I often end up wishing we had more time. There is a short post-discussion write-up each week which I felt like just restating points we made in discussions, but it isn't too much work anyways (2 pages between group members). Finally there is a final project. Really no much limitation to the project, so you get what you put into it.", "[1.0] [Winter 2022] Fantastic course and a real highlight of my quarter! The format of the class is unique and allows for interactive learning by giving you case studies on ocean conservation and letting you research in groups about how to solve the problem. You'd then get feedback from the teaching staff about how to refine your solutions. The frameworks and skills I learnt from this class on problem solving can easily be applied to other contexts as well, and made me more aware of the complex problems that our oceans face(as well as the numerous innovative solutions out there). Another highlight is the field trip to Monterey Bay Aquarium & Whale Watching - a real treat and definitely helps you to realise the real world impact of the case studies. Even if you are not familiar with Marine Biology, this class is still accessible. Be prepared to spend a lot of time working in groups. Professor Crowder and Kanoe(TA) were passionate and knowledgeable about the oceans, and were eager to share their expertise with us.", "[0.6] [Winter 2022] connecting to prof crowder is incredible. he is a great teacher and knowledgable in the field.", "[0.75] [Winter 2022] The field trip is super cool! Larry is the most wholesome professor", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Most of this class is collaborative based, and depends a lot on prior knowledge and experience. The case studies are interesting and relevant, and definitely fuel stimulating discussion. Definitely a good place to meet people and other freshman as well.", "[0.0] [Winter 2022] Do it!"], "OCEANS 71": ["[0.75] [Winter 2022] The professors of this course have a contagious enthusiasm about  ocean health and ocean life and are very approachable. The course is organized to address three perspectives about the ocean: the science of the ocean, ocean related policy and technology to measure changes in the ocean and ocean life. There were interesting outside speakers who play significant roles in the various areas of ocean health and policy that the course covers.", "[0.55] [Winter 2022] This is an enjoyable course. Personally, I liked how the class was taught by a team, and how we often had guest lecturers -- it generated a good diversity of course content. If I have one criticism, it would be that some of the policy discussions in this class can be a bit dry. I preferred those class discussions where we stuck with and explored the science in a more in-depth manner and let that guide the policy discussions.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] This course is very interesting and the teaching team's passion makes the experience that much more engaging.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] This is a great course to get an introduction to ocean issues without getting too specific. You learn about a broad variety of ocean conservation / pollution issues in a very chill environment. The papers are a great way to learn a little bit more about specific topics that interest you without overwhelming you with work.", "[0.4] [Winter 2022] Take it, and take the professors up on meeting outside of class. You can learn a lot about their research and opportunities for students.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] Great course with great instructors", "[0.8] [Winter 2022] Definitely take it! love the professors and the content", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Excellent professors with a wealth of knowledge about the ocean and climate change threats.

Please!! The teaching team is incredible - Rob, Fio, and Steve truly care about the content and it shows. Lectures are incredibly interesting and interactive. I always looked forward to class and section. The few minipapers are very manageable and interesting to write (lots of flexibility). The TAs are fantastic. If you have any trouble with papers, write the TAs and they'll promptly help you. Please take this class, you won't regret it!!!", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] Got a really great overview of the large ocean issues that we're facing and solutions to them from the science, technology, and policy sides. The teaching team is also AMAZING and so knowledgable. If anything, this course is great to connect with them and they are open to talking outside of class about your specific questions/topics of interest. You can learn so much from this course, but you get out what you put in.", "[0.45] [Winter 2022] It is an incredible, flexible course that will get you thinking about oceanography and marine biology in very current, up-to-date terms and solutions.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] If you love the ocean, take this class. The best group of professors and TAs I\u2019ve ever had in my three years here at Stanford. They are truly passionate about their work, have a relaxed learning environment, and they\u2019re great people overall. Take it.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] This was my favorite class this quarter. The teaching team is awesome and you get to learn about the incredible importance of the ocean to our planet - must take!", "[0.8] [Winter 2022] Definitely take it! You have freedom with the topics you explore and the professors are incredibly knowledgeable.", "[0.8] [Winter 2022] The teaching staff does an incredible job of showing how science, policy, and tech intertwine to create the problems and solutions relevant to oceans and coastal communities.

Don't worry about taking furious notes, just try to follow their logic and storytelling in class and learn whatever you can from them. The day I stopped worrying about taking copious notes is the day I started to learn a lot more from this class. Some of the models are confusing and difficult to understand, but Julio will answer a question a hundred times if that's what you need. The readings are interesting, but not always necessary.

I would have liked to have spent more time on individual practice/feedback on things like projection, enunciation and speaking slowly that many people could improve, and maybe less time on the sonnet (I was sick of mine by the end of the quarter). That said, Tom is fantastic and I would recommend this class highly.", "[0.7] [Spring 2019] It's a fun class - just be ready to spend some time memorizing your sonnet near the end of the course.

The professor is very understanding and fun and this is a great course for someone to get outside of their box.", "[0.8] [Spring 2018] Herr Prof Tom is a super cool guy! He has a theatre background so the class has some theatre-y/ improv-y aspects and you will perform a Shakespearean sonnet for the final. If you want a preview into the kind of stuff you might do go to Vocal Yoga at the GSB", "[0.65] [Spring 2018] The closest you will ever get to feeling like you're one of Robin Williams' students in Dead Poets Society.  A very fun class that provides you with a useful set of skills.", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] Take it! The breathing exercises are very relaxing and the voice exercises and group activities are always fun.

Tom brings incredible energy and enthusiasm to the class, and I will miss acting ridiculous with others in the class.", "[0.9] [Spring 2018] This is a great class for a chill quarter!  It is basically a fun study break where you actually learn important life skills regarding public speaking without you even realizing you are learning.

You will not regret it. Tom is an incredible and kind instructor.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2017] This is a light, easy way to add 2 units of good-natured vocal exploration to your week. The class is not demanding at all. Just show up and be willing to take part in the exercises. Tom is a fun, warm professor who draws on his extensive acting training. If you've had previous acting or vocal experience, you may not learn a ton, but you will likely learn *something* new and find the course enjoyable.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2017] Great instructor and very fun.", "[0.85] [Spring 2017] Great class! Definitely worth the 1-unit spent, and it'll be one of the highlights of your day.", "[0.85] [Spring 2017] Yes!

It's a lot of fun, you meet lots of new people, and you learn a lot. Low commitment, and definitely worth it :)", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] It's really great. Not a lot of speaking (the whole first half of the course is just learning vocal control), but definitely a valuable course to become a better public speaker", "[0.75] [Autumn 2016] It's relaxing and very useful!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2016] The class is worth taking! It is a very relaxed, secure environment where you can become more confident with your own voice.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2016] It's an interesting and useful class and it's also fun.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2016] Very relaxed vibe, and the professor is extremely approachable.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2016] This course is less about public speaking and more about vocal exercises and voice capacity mostly applicable to a theater setting.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2016] It's a lot of fun and a pretty relaxing 1 unit class.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2016] Highly recommended - you will definitely learn valuable exercises that will make you a more effective speaker", "[0.25] [Autumn 2016] worth it", "[0.85] [Autumn 2016] This class introduces essential voice techniques with lots of lively class activities.

You are able to choose your own speech topics, so you can explore your interests and learn about a variety of subjects from your classmates! Highly recommend.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] I took this course to get more repetitions in public speaking.  Professor Freeland creates a safe environment to practice...all of the students are supportive and for the most part engaging.", "[0.3] [Winter 2022] This topic of this course is really broad. This can be a double-edged sword because it allows for space for the student to write about whatever they want, but it may not be great for students that would like a greater sense of \"community\" or connection with the course. Due to the broad nature of the course, the content of some lectures can be a little bit unentertaining.", "[0.0] [Winter 2022] This class consists of mostly presentation and most of the learning you'll do will be at the beginning of the quarter.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Definitely consider taking it! Dr. Freeland is a wonderful instructor who truly cares about his students. The feedback you get from your classmates are very variable. It's not everyday when you get such variety of feedback for your speeches!", "[-0.6] [Winter 2022] Take this class to challenge yourself to do more talks and dive into the different ways.

You get out what you put into it, and this course is a safe space for you to take risks and be creative with public speaking.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Professor Freeland is amazing! He makes the environment of the class really friendly and is just a good professor overall. He's very accommodating as well.", "[0.8] [Winter 2022] This is a course I think everyone at Stanford should take. From the hands-on experience giving presentations to the opportunity to meet other incredible students in a warm and supportive environment, this class is one of the most memorable I have ever taken.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Take this course! Dr. Freeland is such a dad \u2014\u00a0he treats us like we're his kids, and he's super supportive. Everyone has a different speech background and starts at different levels, but the course is truly for anyone who is interested.

There isn't too much work for this class either: just preparing and practicing speeches.", "[0.8] [Winter 2022] Cool and laid back class.

The open critiques of your speeches allows for improvement for future presentations. Great mix of required speech types that balance the future needs of students.

Also check out the voice course also by Dr. Freeland for more practice honing vocal skills.", "[1.0] [Winter 2021] Prof. Freeland is a very kind and knowledgeable person. It's fascinating to learn from his experiences and tips. I also appreciated the opportunity to practice public speaking get to feel more comfortable with it.

It's a class where you can coast by spending literally zero minutes outside of class, or you can put more effort in. But you get out what you put in.\n\nTom is literally such a sweetheart and has a world of experience to share. He does like to hear himself talk/goes off topic a lot, but he's really insightful.\n\n\n\nLearn about how to interview well. Learn about phonetics and how to project your voice without going hoarse. Learn how to make good powerpoint slides. Learn how to overcome stage fright. Learn how to minimize filler words or gestures. Learn about appropriate pacing, tonality, how to breathe while speaking, vocal variation. \n\n\n\nThis isn't a class where you spend hours memorizing your speech. You can always have a script, notes, or just go improv. Try multiple ways and see what works. The focus is how you speak and craft your argument, not how you prep.\n\n\n\nGreat class if you're nervous about public speaking. great class if you love public speaking. tom will work with you", "[0.0] [Autumn 2018] Take it.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] Absolutely take it. Dr. Freeland is a living masterclass in what he teaches. It has the feel of an introsem- you can get to know other students and the prof. quite well. The variety in presentations makes it often pretty entertaining too. Make sure to take notes because what Freeland teaches has value far beyond the class.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2018] Dr. Freeland is like a father! I would take this course again just to spend more time with him.  Overall you learn the aspects of what makes a good public speech, but don't get a lot of time to practice. This class is good as an intro, and to get more practice you should probably do other activities alongside it. You get out of the class what you put in. There aren't a lot of deadlines or large amounts of work.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2018] It's a good class to take in general.

This is one of the few opportunities you will have to take a course which is both graduate and undergraduate students where nobody is taking it for a requirement. Most of this class consists of student speeches where people share their passions in life with each other and receive productive critiques on their speaking styles. This class is taught by a remarkable professor, Thomas Freeland, who integrates his sense of humor and vast understanding of oral communication into a great classroom environment.

The class discussions are often \"interesting but irrelevant\", which is ironically a concept (to be avoided) that was introduced in the course. After a person's speech, we'd often spend several minutes discussing the topic rather than the speech's content or delivery. The class feels too long for this reason; it could be pared down and be much more effective. That said, Tom teaches with much warmth and positivity, and the community he fostered was most welcoming. You will finish the class with new confidence and at least four recordings of your speeches--valuable things to bring with you into the future!", "[0.45] [Autumn 2017] This is a really diverse course where you get to improve your speaking skills and interact with many different students", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] I'd recommend it strongly. Thomas has been doing rhetoric for over 20 years and his expertise shines through. Great exercises in breathing, how to mark up a speech, organization of speeches, impromptu speaking. Practical knowledge mixed with some other theoretical stuff.

Taking the course will also help you realize why some of your past speeches worked and some did not. I highly recommend this course! Also notice the progression of the course to see how you should develop a speech holistically.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2016] It's a great way to really get out of your bubble and explore your skills as a public speaker. The instructor is fantastic and is also very supportive. Although I had prior experience in public speaking, I learned extremely valuable information.

Throughout the lecture you will experience the following speeches: self-introduction; telling a personal story; impromptu; demonstration; sales speech; and speech in a special occasion. You will receive feedback from peer students and instructors. You will also have opportunities to watch famous speeches online.", "[0.9] [Summer 2022] The professor for this class, James Wagstaffe, is one of the best professors you will ever have. Even though they're three hours long, his classes are by far the best I've seen. The workload is manageable if you're used to writing speeches, but it's still pretty stressful. Great class overall.", "[0.95] [Summer 2022] Taking this class is so worth the time! I know I signed up for this class due to my fear of public speaking, and this class has helped me overcome that fear. I have successfully learned how to romanticize the room in different situations.

Each lecture was extremely lively, informative, and engaging. Class discussions were always collaborative and eye-opening.   Jim, Bruce, and Susan were amazing professors throughout the entire course; they were extremely helpful, understanding, caring, and knowledgeable.

For example, the elementary quizzes every week seemed quite childish as did all the critiques we had to hand in every class.

The OCT panels, PW2 guest panels and professional workshops were extremely helpful in both developing my personal public speaking skills and providing a preview into my future work. Doree, Helen and Janet also so friendly, warm and encouraging. It was great establishing our work relationships through this training before officially beginning the job.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] Fun to get to know the other OCT-to-bes & the Hume staff is so passionate, kind, and thoughtful about their work.", "[0.75] [Spring 2021] The instructors put a lot of thought and effort into organizing a course that will prepare OCTs for our future jobs.

The instructors are very compassionate and understanding and it makes for a very safe environment!

(if you're gonna be an OCT)", "[0.4] [Spring 2020] It's required... In truth, the class is useful for practicing roleplaying and connecting resources, but I also found the class to be a bit pointless at times. I could very much see a future where this class is done in a 3-day training in Fall Quarter instead.", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] It's an interesting class. You'll probably learn less about actually presenting than you think you will, but its a really positive class environment so fun to take for that alone. It's cool to be in a class with another 20 some people who were all selected to be there based on mutual qualifications, though you all might do things differently due to personal preference", "[0.75] [Spring 2019] I think this course is great! It is taught very well.

Everyone is really nice and supportive. Doree and Helen do a great job of making the class a place about learning and supporting one another.", "[1.0] [Spring 2019] I would say that you have to take to be an OCT, so obviously take it, but understand that a great deal of info in the course is not applicable and will be a bit repetitive. Doree and Helen are so nice though, so it's great to see them get excited about the subject, but I would honestly say having a whole 2-hour class to prepare for tutoring is a bit of overkill. The most helpful thing was shadowing tutors and talking with them about any questions you had, which didn't occur until the very end of class. If we just did maybe 5 shadowing sessions and a couple meet ups to debrief with everyone, I think that would be more than effective in preparing us for our tutoring jobs.", "[0.0] [Spring 2019] The things you will learn in this course will not only apply to your tutoring career but to all your other Stanford endeavors.", "[0.9] [Spring 2019] You have to take this class if you want to be an OCT!

You'll learn a lot about making a concept album, sample lots of music genres (Pink Floyd, Bowie, death....metal.....?) and really just meet a lot of other people who love music too.", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] Most definitely would recommend. Not only is Dr. T the most kind-hearted and coolest professor you will ever have, but you are also exposed to so many different music genres you would have never listened to.

Dr. T is a fantastic teacher who makes the discussions fun and engaging. The course offers you an exploration into some historically very important concept albums, which is a great lens to view different musical genres and see how music evolved. Additionally, the course offers great practical advice in writing strong narratives specifically attention to setting, plot, metaphors, time, and much more.

I strongly recommend you take this course to have a deeper appreciation of music and the art of lyric writing!", "[0.7] [Spring 2020] So fun. It was such a little community for me this quarter (~12 people), I was put on to some music I never would have found otherwise, and I now have an original concept album that I'm going to record. Every week is just listening to 2-3 albums, reading a few excerpts, and talking about music for 3 hours. And you turn in an album at the end.

They provide helpful feedback and try really hard to make the class a warm and supportive community. It is a lot more work than a one-unit course should be, but since it's required for the Braden grant, there's no way out of it. I would say it's more like a two or three unit class, especially with the substantial time commitments to do the assignments in the second half of the course (audio editing and recording is incredibly time consuming). In the final weeks of the quarter, I spent 10-15 hours a week on the podcast-- more than some of my 5-unit classes. You get out of this course what you put into it, though-- if you put work into your podcast it'll be really amazing and you'll be so proud of what you've done. Also the optional readings and listenings that are listed as resources are helpful, like some of the resources on sound design or story structure.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] Definitely take it! I learned so much and Laura and all of the other professors are so sweet and really want to help you succeed!", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] The Braden grant is an amazing opportunity to pursue a passion project, but this class teaches you all of the ways to share that experience with others. I came in without any editing skills, and Laura skillfully structured the class to guide us through the process of parsing through our audio tapes, make decisions about how to translate the experience or interviews we collected into a narrative with a defined plot, experiment with sound design to create a creative audio piece, and train our voices and writing to work well for a bigger audience. The constant mentorship through weekly meetings (and more often when we requested it) was invaluable in getting feedback on the evolving state of our podcast. I don't know how she found the time to listen to 20+ minutes of everyone's podcast each week and give thoughtful comments, but she always did. There were times when all of us were overwhelmed with the scale of the project, but Laura gave us the mentorship we needed to feel capable of taking on the challenge. I came away with the skills to continue making podcast episodes in the future and a fully formed podcast that I'm proud to share with the world.

I always felt behind even after it being a time sink.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] Be prepared to do a lot of work and do not fall behind early on because it will impact you later in the quarter. Make sure you understand the expectations for the course over the summer so you can do your best to prepare then. Come in with a strong idea of what you are going to make the story about and the themes you wish to embed in it or else the script writing phase will be very difficult.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] I really enjoyed my experience with this course.

Laura's feedback and course planning greatly help me improve as a podcaster.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] This is such a fun class! I loved learning how to make podcasts. Laura is a great professor and gave us lots of support throughout our projects. It is a lot of work though, I would say this is more like a 3-4 unit class rather than a 2 unit one.", "[0.85] [Spring 2020] Great course- best if you have the time to invest in it (taking it during a 20 unit quarter is harder)", "[0.8] [Spring 2020] If you have an interest in how to do a podcast and how to storytell, this is a great class for you", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] Dr. T. and the Stanford Storytelling Project staff are phenomenal! The class is approachable for beginners and allows for you to produce any story. The creative freedom is amazing. Also, the support from the instructors was incredible. Please take it!", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] This is a great course to take if you have any interest in podcasting or storytelling. Professor T is super cool and accessible and helpful.", "[0.0] [Spring 2020] This class is 90% story development/writing and only abut 10% oral/technical development.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] A great introduction to podcast storytelling, especially if you've never messed with audio in a hands-on manner before. I think I did kind of misunderstand the nature of the class, though, as I came into the class thinking we would be exposed to more news/trends-related podcasts. Instead, the class was definitely more centered around creating a story based on interview tape, which I felt like was a little more restrictive than I wanted, but still gave me a great intro into how a story is crafted. The staff is very caring and committed.", "[0.9] [Spring 2019] I highly recommend this course if you're curious about podcasting and want to know more. I really enjoyed having the space to craft my own podcast and learn the creative and technical aspects that go into creating a podcast.", "[0.9] [Spring 2018] Take this course if you're interested in storytelling and want to explore how it works in an auditory medium.  Make sure you put in time for the podcasts, they are all very interesting and powerful examples of storytelling. Remember to take time for the final project, too.", "[0.7] [Spring 2018] Good intro to dip your toes in the water. Maybe opt for something more robust later...", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] A great primer to anyone interested in podcasting! Definitely take the class-- the teaching team is a delight, and the work you do is really meaningful.", "[0.85] [Spring 2018] Really interesting course. It was a low time commitment, and I felt like I learned a lot. The listenings required for each week were fascinating.", "[0.9] [Spring 2018] This is a really fun course! Jackson, Christy, and Jonah are fantastic! With that said, given the limited time you are given through a 1-unit course, we just barely scratched the surface of podcasting...so if you're looking for a more comprehensive how-to course, it's worth checking out their 5-unit offerings!", "[0.75] [Winter 2018] this is a really fun class if you like podcasts and want to learn more about how they're structured", "[0.8] [Winter 2018] A good class! Team-taught by many different members of the Stanford Storytelling Project, which was great.", "[0.95] [Winter 2018] I love this class! I've taken it multiple times as part of the Stanford Storytelling Project, and every time it feels fresh and interesting. The skills you learn are applicable to so many other things and it really helps you understand the way stories are put together. The teaching staff are great too. Definitely take it if you're interested!", "[0.0] [Winter 2018] Take it!"], "ORALCOMM 128": [], "ORALCOMM 129": ["[0.85] [Spring 2018] Jake is a very talented practitioner of the craft he's teaching -- and he's an engaging, energetic teacher. There's lots to learn from him.", "[0.65] [Spring 2018] Do it! It's a great time.", "[0.75] [Spring 2018] This class will make you a better storyteller and a deeper, more compassionate thinker.", "[0.8] [Spring 2018] 1. Commit to your project - it's really fulfilling to hear a good one at the end (and show your friends/family) 2. Go to Jake's office hours - he's better than you'll ever be at sound engineering."], "ORALCOMM 177": ["[0.95] [Autumn 2022] Dr. Freeland is a wonderful professor! He's very knowledgable and genuinely cares about his students. A great class to fulfill PWR 2, and you'll learn a lot :)", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] Great class - Dr. Freeland is super friendly, knowledgable, and cares a lot about students. Readings and class discussions were always interesting and engaging.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] Take this course! Dr. Freeland is the best, incredibly understanding and flexible. Great sense of humor! Great in leading class discussions! So many ideas!! Will truly learn a lot from him!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] Tom is an extremely knowledgable and intelligent person who clearly understands rhetoric extremely well, but I think the class structure could use a bit of improvement. We spend ~25-40% of each session discussing a random assortment of current events falling under \"performances of power\" without clear direction and without a level of depth. That portion of the class is like a cursory current affairs course. We then transition to discussing whatever readings were assigned for the given day, but because there's no accountability (required write-ups, etc.), it's pretty clear no one does the readings and so discussion is dry and no one ends up speaking. \n\nIf the course were more meticulously structured, and Tom prepared a more targeted set of notes for each class session in which we stay focused specifically on how rhetoric is used in performances of power (rather than having very open-ended discussions about the text as a whole), I think it would have the potential to be one of the best WRITE 2 offerings.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2022] Definitely do all the readings to get the most out of class! Try to participate as much as you can, as your ideas will always provide some sort of value to the conversation!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] Dr. Freeland is such a kind human being. He wants everyone to stay engaged, he is full of SO much knowledge, and this class always felt like a safe space.", "[0.85] [Spring 2022] Great pwr. Professor is lovely.", "[0.85] [Spring 2022] Dr. Freeland is super knowledgeable about everything! From historical events to current news, he knows it all! He encourages us to discuss and carefully think about everything we see and hear. He is always willing to give feedback on our writings as well.", "[0.7] [Spring 2022] This quarter, we got very little feedback on our work or advice about oration/writing. The class material was interesting (mostly reading and discussing speeches), but I don't think I learned much because the few assignments were just work to do without feedback to iterate or improve. Dr. Freeland is very chill.", "[0.45] [Spring 2022] good PWR2 course", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] Great class. Professor Freeland clearly loves to teach and his passion for his students and general performance of power topics is really apparent and infectious.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] It's a super easy writing 2 that counts for pwr2. Tom is the best. Super sweet. rambles a lot.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Dr. Freeland is an amazing person and his class is equally amazing! Fun time and not stressful. He really cares about students and understands you have other things going on in life outside of class.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Very fun & relaxed class with interesting readings. Tom spends lots of time discussing current events in the class, which makes it even more interesting and relevant. The class has less structure than a normal PWR 2 class, so you get out of it as much as you put in.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2021] Great course. One of the courses you should take before you graduate.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] Definitely take it, Dr. Freeland is the best!", "[0.75] [Autumn 2021] This is a great course which focuses on the application of communication theory on the structure of power dynamics throughout history.", "[0.3] [Autumn 2021] Absolutely worth it for a simple PWR 2 pass class", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Great class! Dr Freeland is so kind. Great experience overall.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Tom is awesome! He really cares about all of his students, and not only was this a great way to fulfill PWR 2, but it was also a way for me to think more about my oral presentation skills. Having 1:1 sessions with him to discuss our papers or go over recordings of our in-class presentations really helped me improve over the course of the quarter. I'm even thinking about taking a course with Tom in the future to further my practice with public speaking.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] It was a super fun class to hear other's thoughts and discussions about the readings or modern news topics! I recommend this class highly for the WR2 requirement", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] I would strongly recommend this class. It is a good way to fulfill the WRITE 2 requirement and the class is mostly just discussion-based. There are a few readings, but all of the writing assignments had a great deal of freedom of choice in the topic and Professor Freeland is very willing to let you explore your own interests in the essays.", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] Do take it. Best way to fulfill PWR 2. Many discussions I had in this class sparked conversation among friends after. I could see this being a good way to get to know people in a non-remote quarter.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] Tom is an amazing and caring teacher. He also is a great instructor who is aware of the difficulties during covid. He engages not students not only in the world of writing and oral speaking, but in the world around us. Thank you Tom for a wonderful quarter.", "[1.0] [Spring 2021] Tom is AMAZING. I came in expecting to just be fulfilling a PWR 2 requirement, but he's so passionate about current events and our topics that the energy is infectious through the whole class. Because we had to reach out to Tom on our own to get into the class, it tended to self-select for students who really wanted to thoughtfully engage outside of just PWR 2, which totally worked--I had so much respect for my classmates and of all the online classes I've taken, I feel like I got to know all of these classmates the best. We're going to hopefully have a reunion so I can see all of these great people again, which is just more evidence for how well Tom creates a meaningful class environment.", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] Tom is great! I loved being able to fulfill PWR 2 with this class. The class is very flexible and discussion-based; we talked a lot about current events.", "[0.9] [Spring 2021] Take the course!!!! Professor Freeland is one of the best lecturers I've had during my time here, and he brings a lot of captivating perspectives about a lot of subjects that we cover in discussion. Discussions are very entertaining and I always felt like I learned something from the other students.", "[0.85] [Spring 2021] I highly recommend taking this course for your PWR 2! It is interesting and a more relaxed way to fill the requirement.", "[1.0] [Spring 2021] Professor Freeland is excellent!! I so enjoyed this class--the content was really interesting and Professor Freeland made the class environment welcoming and enjoyable. I would highly recommend this class to fulfill your PWR 2 requirement. I enjoyed it much more than my PWR 1.", "[0.95] [Spring 2021] Amazing class - Tom is the most empathetic professor who cares deeply about your learning and the material is very interesting. Would 10/10 recommend.", "[1.0] [Spring 2021] tom is an amazing lecturer. he does tend to go on tangents sometimes, but everything tom brings up is always incredibly interesting and insightful. i loved discussing performances in power in current events with my peers, and our discussions were always fun. absolutely loved the freedom i had in this course to write about really anything i wanted (and many of my peers did as well which made for amazing final presentations).", "[0.7] [Autumn 2020] Professor Freeland is one of the most understanding yet down-to-earth and insightful professors I've had thus far. His presence at Stanford is truly a present ?? he gifts his students a special perspective on life and performances of power in both the ancient and modern.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] There is no professor like Prof. Freeland at Stanford. I admire his leniency and respect for students, and I, in return, have great respect for him. He is a very knowledgeable, well-read, informed person. I'm very happy I took the class and I wish there are other classes I can take with him. We discussed U.S. politics a lot in class. So, if you're into that, you will enjoy this class a lot.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2020] Really take it! Its great!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2020] Take this class. Not just for WR2 but for Prof. Freeland. He's super receptive and has intriguing conversations and just knows so much. Also the syllabus is awesome and gives great historical perspective as to where we are now.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2020] Definitely take this without hesitation, Professor Freeland keeps topics of conversation relevant and interesting.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2020] Take this class! Thomas is great and so understanding; the material is interesting as well", "[0.7] [Autumn 2020] Read or watch the news daily so you can get more out of the class and have a meaningful contribution to the class. Tom is a very genuine teacher so you'll have a lot of fun if you match that", "[0.8] [Spring 2020] It is a great course because professor Freeland is patient and friendly. He is really knowledgeable", "[0.75] [Spring 2020] Make sure to find a topic that you're very passionate about. You want to be able to dig deep and give a lot of thought to it", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] Take it! Professor Freeland is very engaging and passionate about what he teaches. He is also a strong believer of shifting the conversation of lectures to discuss contemporary issues that matter. Of all my professors this quarter, Professor Freeland did the best job of opening class conversations about race relations in America, the COVID pandemic, and the upcoming political election.", "[0.85] [Spring 2020] Really amazing and eye opening conversations, lots of potential learning if you participate and a great professor to learn from and simply just get to know!", "[0.0] [Spring 2020] TAKE IT!", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] Take it! Professor Freeland is amazingly kind and understanding and is open to any ideas you might be interested in. Truly a great instructor", "[0.5] [Spring 2020] Please bring your curiosity for a variety of real-wolrd isssues to this class. You are challenged to engage in this classss by thinking about both power and the art of performance in real-life examples.", "[0.95] [Spring 2020] I would say it's certainly one of the better ways to get your Write-2 out of the way. Prof Freeland is extremely interesting and is unbelievably knowledgeable on a variety of different subjects. Had it been a normal quarter, I certainly would have loved the opportunity to get to know him better.", "[0.75] [Spring 2020] The class structure allows students to express their political opinions. If your views do not align with the classes, it will be frustrated. However, Professor Freeland is an amazing prof who truly cares about his students. Course load is light.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] Great class. Tom is the best at what he does", "[0.6] [Autumn 2019] take it - Tom is great and you will learn so much about many different things including current and historical events", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] Definitely take this class! Tom is such a sweet and understanding person, and honestly makes this class amazing. As a CS major who doesn't really enjoy writing, I can say that I really enjoyed attending classes and learned a lot from this quarter. You pretty much spend the quarter analyzing speeches, writing/delivering speeches, and then presentations and one research paper, but it's an overall fairly relaxed class.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] This is an AMAZING course. If you can take it you absolutely should. Tom is one off the best, if not the best professor I have ever had at Stanford. You learn how to become a better speaker and presenter in this class and that will help you in so many ways outside of class. If you can take this class you definitely should.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Wonderful course with a great, caring professor. Very discussion-focused with a good amount of reading, but manages to stay engaging, exciting, and relevant.", "[0.4] [Autumn 2019] Very cool introduction to history of the world", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Take it!

He truly encourages you to explore your own interests and passions, and definitely knows a lot about so many things! It's great to hear him go off on tangents, and a wonderful opportunity for organic learning too.", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] a great class. Freeland cares so much about his student and is well read in a variety of topics. 10/10 recommend.", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] Take it, it's incredibly enjoyable. Freeland is very entertaining and knows a lot of things about a lot of things. Some of his stories, on top of the work, are incredible.", "[0.65] [Winter 2019] Absolutely take it. Best class I've had at Stanford so far.", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] Definitely take this! Professor Freeland is super cool and understanding. The assignments are really interesting and unique and Prof Freeland is really lenient. It is also a plus if you've taken Face of Battle with him.", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] You might not learn a lot (this is, after all, still sort of a PWR2 class), but definitely fun, flexible, and fascinating to hear stories from the instructor.", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] This class is not terribly demanding, and the subject offers a breadth of opportunity to explore topics of personal interest. The performative element is unique and engaging, while the in-class discussions tend to be tangential. This is sometimes extremely interesting, but unpredictable.", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] This is a great course if you're looking to fulfill you're pwr 2 requirement or just looking for a good public speaking class. Prof.Freeland is very dedicated to teach and is understanding and lenient when it comes to due dates and deadlines. The final essay is about analyzing a performance of power so it's a relatively flexible topic compared to other pwr classes.", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] Professor Freeland is a gem. Take this course if you get in! He's a sweetheart and cares about his students, and is also so passionate and enthusiastic.", "[0.85] [Winter 2019] Great class! Perhaps not the best for pure skills development, but a fantastic professor who leads engaging discussions.", "[0.85] [Winter 2019] Dr. Freeland makes this class a real joy. Any topic relating to performances of power are open for discussion in class. Very flexible with deadlines, and practice with different forms of oration that I found more rewarding than typical PWR2 milestone presentations.", "[0.7] [Winter 2019] I am fascinated by Freeland's teaching style because we go on tangents all the time yet there always seems to be things to learn from discussions on those tangents. The performance of power is everywhere in the world, and this class helps to be more aware. Take it!", "[0.85] [Spring 2018] Great course and professor freeland is a fantastic instructor", "[0.6] [Spring 2018] Professor Freeland is a great source.", "[0.4] [Spring 2018] Yes-Prof. Freeland is a smart guy but he seems to have a strange fixation on the Nazis. He brings them up almost every class, but rarely says anything about the atrocities they committed. He more just adds factoids and curious tidbits about the Nazis, sometimes in joking times. I felt very uncomfortable to be in the class when he did this.", "[0.45] [Spring 2018] Highly recommend taking this class!", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] Thomas is incredible. The most fun (and potentially most interesting) class I've taken this quarter, and I'm a CS major on the AI track. If you can manage to get into this class, you've scored yourself an incredibly sweet deal. This should be your top pick for PWR 2, because there's no better way to fulfill it than to spend incredible quality time with Thomas. He's incredibly engaging, knowledgeable, and likable. He's a really cool dude, and you should honestly just take the class to get to meet him. I hope you get in! MUST TAKE.", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] Great course! Prof. Freeland is a passionate instructor, and the material is engaging and interesting. You'll analyze a corpus of powerful speakers throughout history, deliver several speeches of your own, and and come away with a better understanding of the  role of power in performance, as well as performance in power.", "[0.8] [Winter 2018] Great class! The instructor is very nice and knowledgable. Excpect to give several presentations in front of the entire class.", "[0.9] [Winter 2018] It's an easy and decently interesting way to satisfy the PWR 2 requirement, but don't expect to learn a great deal. Even though the class is supposedly about public speaking, most of the class time is generally spent getting sucked into political debates about the policies presented in speeches. Relatively little attention is paid to the speeches themselves. So, if arguing about hot-button political issues is your thing (or if you want a relaxed writing course), I would recommend this class. But if you really want an intensive public speaking workshop, you might want to look elsewhere.", "[0.95] [Winter 2018] Freeland is great! He's very energetic and makes the discussions very fun. Good class to take for PWR 2", "[0.6] [Winter 2018] An easy and fun class and a good way to fullfill the PWR2 requirement, but don't expect to learn much.", "[0.95] [Winter 2018] You will learn a lot about public speaking from Prof. Freeland, he knows how to teach oration very well, it's amazing to learn from him. He is also very chill and easy to talk to, so definitely talk with him about other topics you are interested about!", "[1.0] [Winter 2018] This class is a great way to fulfill your PWR 2/ WRITE 2 requirement. Dr. Tom has a theater background and so brings an interesting perspective to speaking and let's you have a pretty wide range of options for how you/ in what style you perform/give your speeces. He's super enganging and the material covered is very interesting. I think he's just a super cool guy and would recommend taking the class just to get to know him and learn from him.", "[0.8] [Winter 2018] Definitely less work than a regular PWR 2, though interesting only if you're keen on learning about the topic.", "[0.95] [Winter 2018] IF AT ALL POSSIBLE TAKE THIS!!! Besides being PWR 2 It is that magical mix of a class that you learn something in but you don't have to stress out about it. Professor Freeland is so knowledgable, enthusiastic, and understanding - really a great class", "[0.85] [Winter 2018] Make sure to stay up until midnight to guarantee getting a spot in this class. Demand for this class is massive, and is probably going to increase. Great class.", "[0.9] [Winter 2018] Take this course! Professor Freeland is very knowledgeable and helpful. It's a great way to satisfy PWR2.", "[-0.6] [Autumn 2016] If you are going to have opposing views (conservative views) then you should either be prepared to constantly defend your side (even from the attacks of your theater PHD teacher) or sit quietly and hear why you are wrong.", "[0.1] [Autumn 2016] come to class with an example of a performance of power you want to talk about", "[0.9] [Autumn 2016] This is a great class for those who are interested in politics and question why we are so drawn to certain individuals in society. I recommend, especially as a substitute for PWR2.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2016] Take this course! Freeland is very engaging and always willing to help.

You'll always either gain deeper insights and new perspectives into matters you're already aware of, or gain completely new information on historical and current events.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2016] Take it!", "[0.75] [Autumn 2016] An enjoyable PWR2 experience with a knowledgable and caring professor", "[0.85] [Autumn 2016] It's a fun easy way to fulfill the PWR requirement for sophomore year, however it is not very organized.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2016] Definitely a must, learned a lot while taking it. Professor Freeland is very approachable, and shares a lot of his knowledge if you just ask. Take it preferably during a year of a presidential election. This fact shaped the course a lot this quarter, and I cannot think of any other way this course could have left me so much.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2016] Take it! Professor Freeland really cares about the students."], "ORALCOMM 215": ["[0.95] [Autumn 2022] I highly recommend! The class itself is a mix of vocal exercises all centered around using your voice, and it was very fun and engaging.

His energy makes you want to join him in exploring the wonders of the voice.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] You will see great improvement in your voice projection, confidence, and articulation if you take this class. You will get to do many silly and fun exercise that actually works. A great start to my Tuesday and Thursday.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] It's more theater focused than I thought it would be. Tom is an excellent Professor and has a method to what he is doing. He gets you out of your comfort zone and better prepares you to speak publicly. He is an awesome Professor that really cares about his students, I wish I would've dedicated more time to this class instead of other math and science classes.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] this is a really fun class!

Amazing professor!!!", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] This course will likely encourage you out of your comfort zone in a way that is understanding of people's individual differences, well-considered and enjoyable. You will learn a lot of interesting connections between the physicality of your body and your voice, as well as many exercises/activities for warming up and for relaxing. It is a thoroughly enjoyable and very worthwhile course.", "[0.8] [Spring 2022] The class took more of a theater/acting emphasis than I expected, for what it's worth.

Please take it.", "[0.85] [Spring 2022] This course is absolutely transforming if you are looking to explore using your voice and are willing to let go of your ego. Tom is such an experienced and knowledgeable instructor who always creates engaging activities in class. I enjoyed the course a lot and it is definitely one of the most memorable classes I've taken at Stanford.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] Great Instructor, Tom is very passionate about what he teaches and it is great fun (although exercises can get very weird). However, the course doesn't really teach anything hands-on to improve presentations, rather it seems like an intro to theater voice.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] Great overview of voice exercises. Much of the class is going over different exercises and the reason behind doing them. A good amount of theory, through the lens of acting and language techniques, were brought up that were interesting and useful. I learned things like protecting one's voice to prevent the often untreatable vocal nodules or not opening one's jaw too wide. The final assignment is reciting a Shakespeare sonnet--if memorization is hard for you, don't wait till the last day to memorize.", "[0.0] [Spring 2022] .", "[0.8] [Autumn 2021] Dr. Freeland is very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about his subject.  My favorite part of the course was the second half where we had a focus on articulation and enunciation.  The first few weeks go by somewhat slowly.  This course is very low workload and a lot of fun.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] Take it! I went in feeling very insecure about my voice, but this course will made me feel much more confident about projecting my voice and speaking in public.

Also this course is very low stakes which I APPRECIATE so much.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] An extremely fun voice course. Not what I expected, because I came in thinking it would be presentation/public speaking heavy. The teaching is based in theatre/acting, which I found a pleasant surprise.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2021] This course is not like the description but it is fun, refreshing, sometimes awkward but engaging.

The professor is very understanding and fun and this is a great course for someone to get outside of their box.", "[0.8] [Spring 2018] Herr Prof Tom is a super cool guy!

The class is not demanding at all. Just show up and be willing to take part in the exercises. Tom is a fun, warm professor who draws on his extensive acting training. If you've had previous acting or vocal experience, you may not learn a ton, but you will likely learn *something* new and find the course enjoyable.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2017] Great instructor and very fun.", "[0.85] [Spring 2017] Great class!

It's a lot of fun, you meet lots of new people, and you learn a lot. Low commitment, and definitely worth it :)", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] It's really great. Not a lot of speaking (the whole first half of the course is just learning vocal control), but definitely a valuable course to become a better public speaker", "[0.75] [Autumn 2016] It's relaxing and very useful!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2016] The class is worth taking! It is a very relaxed, secure environment where you can become more confident with your own voice.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2016] It's an interesting and useful class and it's also fun.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2016] Very relaxed vibe, and the professor is extremely approachable.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2016] This course is less about public speaking and more about vocal exercises and voice capacity mostly applicable to a theater setting.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2016] It's a lot of fun and a pretty relaxing 1 unit class.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2016] Highly recommended - you will definitely learn valuable exercises that will make you a more effective speaker", "[0.25] [Autumn 2016] worth it", "[0.85] [Autumn 2016] This class introduces essential voice techniques with lots of lively class activities.

Professor Freeland creates a safe environment to practice...all of the students are supportive and for the most part engaging.", "[0.3] [Winter 2022] This topic of this course is really broad. This can be a double-edged sword because it allows for space for the student to write about whatever they want, but it may not be great for students that would like a greater sense of \"community\" or connection with the course. Due to the broad nature of the course, the content of some lectures can be a little bit unentertaining.", "[0.0] [Winter 2022] This class consists of mostly presentation and most of the learning you'll do will be at the beginning of the quarter.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Definitely consider taking it!

He makes the environment of the class really friendly and is just a good professor overall. He's very accommodating as well.", "[0.8] [Winter 2022] This is a course I think everyone at Stanford should take.

Also check out the voice course also by Dr. Freeland for more practice honing vocal skills.", "[1.0] [Winter 2021] Prof. Freeland is a very kind and knowledgeable person. It's fascinating to learn from his experiences and tips. I also appreciated the opportunity to practice public speaking get to feel more comfortable with it.

It's a class where you can coast by spending literally zero minutes outside of class, or you can put more effort in. But you get out what you put in.\n\nTom is literally such a sweetheart and has a world of experience to share. He does like to hear himself talk/goes off topic a lot, but he's really insightful.\n\n\n\nLearn about how to interview well. Learn about phonetics and how to project your voice without going hoarse. Learn how to make good powerpoint slides. Learn how to overcome stage fright. Learn how to minimize filler words or gestures. Learn about appropriate pacing, tonality, how to breathe while speaking, vocal variation. \n\n\n\nThis isn't a class where you spend hours memorizing your speech. You can always have a script, notes, or just go improv. Try multiple ways and see what works. The focus is how you speak and craft your argument, not how you prep.\n\n\n\nGreat class if you're nervous about public speaking. great class if you love public speaking. tom will work with you", "[0.0] [Autumn 2018] Take it.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] Absolutely take it. Dr. Freeland is a living masterclass in what he teaches. It has the feel of an introsem- you can get to know other students and the prof. quite well.

Make sure to take notes because what Freeland teaches has value far beyond the class.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2018] Dr. Freeland is like a father! I would take this course again just to spend more time with him.  Overall you learn the aspects of what makes a good public speech, but don't get a lot of time to practice.

This is one of the few opportunities you will have to take a course which is both graduate and undergraduate students where nobody is taking it for a requirement.

The class discussions are often \"interesting but irrelevant\", which is ironically a concept (to be avoided) that was introduced in the course. After a person's speech, we'd often spend several minutes discussing the topic rather than the speech's content or delivery. The class feels too long for this reason; it could be pared down and be much more effective. That said, Tom teaches with much warmth and positivity, and the community he fostered was most welcoming. You will finish the class with new confidence and at least four recordings of your speeches--valuable things to bring with you into the future!", "[0.45] [Autumn 2017] This is a really diverse course where you get to improve your speaking skills and interact with many different students", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] I'd recommend it strongly.

There is a lot of basic extraneous work built into the course though for people who have not read any scientific papers or designed experiments (as if it's an intro freshman class rather than a higher level depth course)", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] Great class. The project proposal is a little intimidating but you work on it throughout the quarter with a TA and Fan. Fan tries to meet with each group twice a quarter, which is really helpful.

Not one to be overly-enthusiastic about classes, but this was hands down my favorite class at Stanford.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2019] I would highly, highly, highly recommend this course! In terms of the PWR2 requirements, there was a ton of freedom in choosing topics for the final RBA (we could choose whatever sports medicine topic we wanted, even those not covered in the course or only loosely related), and the oral presentations and short papers were very clear in the instructions. It was hard to believe that a class I enjoyed so much also fulfilled the PWR2 requirement I'd been dreading and made fulfilling the requirement something I looked forward to. The lectures, including guest lectures and other students' presentations, were very engaging.

The papers can be tough if you haven't done scientific writing before. On the whole, highly recommended.", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] It is an interesting class but be prepared to do all of the work by yourself. Be prepared to not have much instruction from Dr. Hwang in class.

It is amazing.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] Kevin and Selena were passionate teachers. Although quality of teaching was just pretty good. I think we need to do away with such menial details. Like we don't need to know how to identify certain animals. It would be much more beneficial to understand some of the functional traits that animal have, how they facilitate ecosystem processes, how they contribute to the integrity of the ecosystem. Nobody in this program needs to know how to identify the family a fish belongs to just by looking at it. Selena needs to do a better job at paying respect and acknowledging the traditional custodians of the ocean country of Heron Island. Not once did we learn about or from them. No more perforative activism.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] This course was probably the one with the heaviest workload of the Australia program, but it was 100% worth it. Heron Island is one of the coolest places I've ever been to in my life. All of the snorkels and labs are so so so worth it, you'll see once-in-a-lifetime stuff every day you're here. From the snorkeling to beach volleyball, take advantage of all there is to do!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] This class was so hard. Again, no rubric or guidance on assignments. If you are not an Earth Systems or Biology major this class will be very difficult. They give you 12 hours to study for the exam. There is a lab exam. Part of the lab exam was them testing you on the name of the equipment in a lab that we literally spent less than 2 hours in. The course is interesting. Sometimes the profs would try to make things more simple that it actually became more confusing. Heron Island is great. Best location of the trip. Being on the GBR was amazing. Wish there was more boat snorkels.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2022] Lecture and labs are straightforward and enjoyable, both exams primarily test memorization, ask questions about more complex topics if you\u2019re not familiar", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] This course is a highlight of the Australia study abroad program. Heron Island is one of the most beautiful places I've ever been -- the wildlife, the island itself, the research station -- all of it feels so unreal. Take advantage of every opportunity while you're there! You go straight from snorkeling to class to beach volleyball -- it's such a magical way to learn with such awesome professors and tutors.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] Loved this course so so much! By far the best part of the entire study abroad for me, Heron is incredible and so is that teaching team.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] One of the most exciting and engaging courses I've ever taken. Kevin and Selina are incredible teachers and the field components are unmatched.

Really loves Selina and Kevin.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] I loved learning about the incredibly complex and diverse coral reef ecosystem and there's no better way to be immersed in a class than to be physically walking and swimming in your classroom. The tutors are amazing and definitely add an important level of knowledge and interaction.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] I learned a lot in this course because the lectures slides are extremely numerous but sometimes it felt like we given too much information. The labs on Heron Island are really fun and it was great getting to go out on a boat to snorkel and identify fish species.

Study for the lab exam, especially if you are like me and are not a bio major and dont know taxonomy.  Know your taxonomy!  ALso, pay attention in labs.  They wont test u on anything you havent seen before in them.  Most of them are very self-lead so be explorative!  Also snorkle a ton and go out on reef flat walks to see all of the stuff you are learning in its natural habitat!", "[0.05] [Autumn 2018] CRE class was very packed and left little time to truly absorb the material. I think they did not take into account students exhaustion from 3 full travel days to arrive on Heron island when scheduling lectures which resulted in very low engagement and very tired students. Overall, the labs were fairly interesting but the amount of material it was expected that you would get from/retain from lab was a little unreasonable. The staff were disappointed in our performance on the lab exam as a result. Additionally, one of the labs did not have enough microscopes to accommodate the number of students in each lab group which definitely detracted from the experience of some students such as myself", "[-0.7] [Autumn 2018] Such a nightmare without Kevin teaching it too.

The course is really interesting, with a lot of cool hikes through K'gari's forests. Not too much (or too little) work, Toby is the perfect professor and balances out students' needs incredibly well. There's also a really fun swimming hole at Dilli Village that you should take advantage of, especially on the really hot days.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] If you aren't Earth Systems or Biology this class will be difficult. Toby is really nice and accommodating professor. He cares a lot. K'gari is beautiful but also a death island. Can't go in the ocean because of tiger sharks. Spiders size of palm. 9/10 most deadliest snakes. Have to run within the campground because you can't run outside the campground because dingoes will think you're prey and chase you. Field work was low key boring and pointless. Wasn't actually very low key. Beautiful island that i wish we got to explore more of. Would've loved to spend more time in the rainforest actually hiking. The food is great. Best food you'll have out of the research stations. Unreasonable for Stanford to market this study abroad program as people of all backgrounds.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2022] Amazing instructor, ask questions and have conversations, lectures and labs straightforward, tutorials also straightforward, start lab journal early as it takes some time to complete", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] I learned SO much in this course! Of course, I learned about terrestrial ecology and Australia's diverse ecosystems. We learned from our tutors and instructor Toby about Australia's flora and fauna, and our tutor Jessa especially sparked our love of bugs! More importantly, however, I learned so much about Indigenous Knowledge and the importance of environmental justice. The talks we had with Toby, Coen, the Butchulla women, BAC, and our tutors were some of the most life changing experiences of my entire study abroad experience. Toby is an absolutely incredible instructor and I cannot praise him enough for his humility, ability to acknowledge his own faults, and openness to learning how to practice science in a more conscientious, just way.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2022] So interesting. You will learn a lot about the bigger picture of the ecology you are studying which is so important!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] Toby is such an incredible professor, one of those teachers that makes you excited about something you didn't think you'd be.

Focus not only on lecture content but also fieldwork!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Might be my favorite of the australian program! Claire is so awesome and the Sheoak property is so amazing. Go on night nature walks every night and get to know the TAs!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] This was a really fun course to begin the Australia abroad program with because it's completely immersive in your learning environment and Sheoak Ridge is a very unique place. There is a good amount of work to do with learning the course material, the lab assignments and other debate activities but all a great deal of fun. The tutors are also so incredible and really add to the teaching team.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] I really enjoyed this class and Claire is a great lecturer and person. She and the TAs make the field activities really fun and we learn a lot. It was good that we started off at Sheoak Ridge because everyone got to know each other since we had limited wifi and were pretty much disconnected from the rest of society.", "[0.3] [Autumn 2019] Study more than you think for the exam- Claire says it is easy but it was the hardest of all the Australia courses.

It was poorly organized and quite frustrating.", "[-1.0] [Autumn 2022] Firstly, Ian Tibbets had no schedule for the course. He had one that he had to submit for approval but then decided to not follow the schedule at all. This was horrible because he did not provide an alternative schedule.  This left students unsure on what their plan was for the day, then would get berated by the teaching staff for being late for something we didn't know we had to be there for??? Like wth. \nThen, Ian Tibbets is a horrible educator. He would say random ass stuff and go on tangents. There was no clear line between what was important and when he was making some joke. Ian Tibbets does not give clear directions on assignments. He told us we had to write a special report and then said he would go over the requirements the next day. The next day he showed us an example and said here are the expectations: no color on graphs, no titles on graphs. Like, okay but what do you want in terms of content. \nIan Tibbets grades subjectively. Never were we provided with any sort of rubric for a writing assignment. This created uncertainty for expectations as well as the grade we received. When we got back graded papers, there was just a number. We never knew why points were taken off. \nIan Tibbets and the Moreton Bay Research Station have a horrible reputation in the local community. Local would be pleasant with us and then would frown when told we were staying at the research station. Also, Tibbets say that the community was violent, dangerous, and alcoholics because they were indigenous and a miners society. Ian Tibbets has no regard for the wellbeing of wildlife. He picked up a puffer fish out of the water and held it in the air, knowing that we should not be removing vertebrates from the water. Another person at the research station picked up a carpet shark by the tail and allowed it to thrash in panic while on a snorkel. I have no idea how these people have long established careers in these fields and don't know how to treat these animals with respect.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] The material was really interesting, but Ian wasn't the most organized. I liked the learning aspects but the assignments were a little unclear at times. We had a lot of free time on Minjerribah \u2014 go to Point Lookout while here! We saw rays, dolphins, sharks, turtles and more on the Gorge Walk.", "[-0.95] [Autumn 2022] This was the worst class I have ever taken at Stanford. Ian is completely disorganized. You cannot understand a single thing he is saying. He kept moving the date of the exam. When asking a logistical question to him or the tutors they were rude and acted like you were a complete idiot. The special report is a science report. We received no information on what this was until 8/9pm on Thursday night and it was due at 9am in the morning. He takes off points and doesn't tell you why. There is no assignment sheet that tells you what there expectations are or what should be included in each section. There is no rubric. The exam is hard. The field work is boring. The location is depressing. It is a waste of 10 days and all the money we spend on Stanford tuition. A real disappointment", "[0.4] [Autumn 2022] Content slightly unorganized, ask questions, exam is memorization, special report takes the most time, start early", "[0.8] [Autumn 2022] I think Ian did a really good job relating to and communicating with students, but I think ultimately the timing of this course really detracted from the learning experience. The teaching staff was really tired and the schedule fell apart completely. I wish we had had more structure, more activities, and more time in the field to get hands on experiences with the concepts we were discussing. Overall, I did love Minjerribah and thought what we learned was really applicable to real life experiences on sea shores.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2019] 100% recommend!

Chris is an old man that does not understand that the world in changing. The worst part about his grading is that he will leave comments expressing his disagreement with the argument you are making, rather than the quality of your argument. Additionally, his expertise on Aboriginal Studies is extremely lacking. He will water down the violences done upon Aboriginal Australians by European colonizers. He will argue that there was no genocide in Australia. Additionally, he showed us a movie depicting racial and sexual violence without any trigger warning. Some students were severely affected. He told us afterwards that he did not watch the movie in full before showing the whole class. Quite odd. Poor behavior.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2022] Interesting course, good overview of mainstream Australian history.

Can't stress it enough, she made every class so much fun and the fact that the class was flexible enough to teach us what we found to be relevant as we spent time in Berlin was great. Such a great time in this class, and you really do learn so much so fast.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Diana is genuinely the best teacher, language and all other subjects, I've ever had. She's perfected her craft- you can really tell that every action and exercise she initiates in the class has so much research and work behind it. She knows exactly how to talk to language learners, is ridiculously organized, cares so, so much about her students and her work, and also makes the class so much fun! It was ridiculous how fast my German improved- I went from not knowing a lick of German to being able to hold conversations, comprehend most of the signs around me, and even hold job interviews by the end of the quarter.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2021] it is great, definitely recommend!", "[0.75] [Autumn 2019] Diana and Sylvia are both incredible professors.

She made learning German, which initially seemed like a daunting task, super enjoyable and also much easier than I expected it to be.

One of my favorite professors I've had at Stanford.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] Diana is an amazing teacher. I would highly recommend this class thanks to her excellent teaching skills.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2019] Diana is such an incredible instructor. She made me feel comfortable enough to make the countless mistakes inevitable in learning a new language, but she always pushed me to be better and not give up when it became frustrating. It was definitely a lot of work, especially if you want to retain anything. But overall it was worth it!", "[0.7] [Autumn 2019] Diana is an incredible instructor. She spends time on concepts that confuse us while also making the class enjoyable and fun!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] Take it! It is the best way to learn German and Diana makes it very fun", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] Diana is an amazing instructor! She makes class interesting and engaging, and does a great job of teaching German skills that are relevant to life in Berlin.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] German is a tough language, especially for me. I wish Sylvia was more supportive of the weaker students in the class, but by the end, you see your progress and gain a deeper desire to continue learning the language.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] Great class, Sylvia is so sweet and really wants you to learn!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] Great course! Sehr gut! Sylvia is great", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] It's a lot of work, but Sylvia is an incredible teacher and person and if you put the time and effort in then you'll truly see a lot of improvement by the end of the quarter!", "[1.0] [Autumn 2019] Sylvia is such a great instructor. I am so grateful for her support this quarter and know she only wants the best for her students. If you put in the work (which I definitely would recommend) you can come out with some pretty substantial German capabilities.", "[0.2] [Autumn 2019] You will learn a lot in a short period of time. Stay on top of the homework and go to class every day.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Sylvia is by far the best language instructor I've ever had. If concern about taking 8 units of German is holding you back from doing the Berlin program -- please don't worry. Although we meet for 2 hours a day, the workload is extremely manageable and learning German is super fun and useful! It was a wonderful experience learning German with Sylvia, as was the rest of the program.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2019] It's more difficult than you might expect but Sylvia is really nice and it's hard to fail.  Also very demanding in terms of class time/work.  Fun to bond with other students over and spend time doing though and you do learn some German.  Also not for the faint of heart in terms of mornings.", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] Diana is a great instructor and a wonderful teacher. She understands how language teaching and understanding functions and tailors the course to students' needs. I am very happy I had my introduction to German with her.", "[0.75] [Winter 2019] DIANA IS THE BEST!! Take it with her if you can.", "[0.4] [Winter 2019] It helps your German a lot.", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] Great course. Diana is a fantastic teacher and makes class really engaging. I ended up with a fairly useful level of German", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] Lots of class time but Diana is the best German teacher", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] Sylvia is a such a dear. She is probably one of the best teachers I've had in my time at Stanford. She really cares about teaching students and making every day interesting. We all loved her! The class is a time commitment but you leave it knowing it was worth it. It's kind of incredible how much we learned in such a short period of time. Going from knowing absolutely no German to writing essays and reading plays is huge!", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] In just 10 weeks your German will get so good! I'm really impressed by the quality of the instruction. The class was both meaningful and really enjoyable.", "[0.6] [Winter 2019] Really fun!", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] If you can take it with Sylvia! She is one of few teachers who genuinely care about the learning experience of all her students. The class is long (two hours daily) but the homework load is light and the class itself is quite rewarding.", "[0.4] [Winter 2019] engage in class as much as possible!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] Diana is a fantastic instructor - very patient and thoughtful, which is helpful when learning a new language. Make sure to keep up with daily assignments because it's much more helpful than cramming in developing your language proficiency", "[1.0] [Autumn 2018] This class is super fun!  It is required if you are studying in Berlin, and it is early in the morning every day, but Diana makes it so much fun.  I really enjoyed being in her class and I feel I learned a great deal of German from practicing in class every day.  Diana is amazing!!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] Diana is definitely the best German teacher. She is very nice and fun.", "[0.35] [Autumn 2018] you will learn german very well", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] This has been one of my favorite classes I have taken at Stanford so far. I learned an incredible amount of German in 10 weeks and Diana is one of the best teachers I have ever had. She is kind and makes class so enjoyable.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] Diana is a wonderful German teacher! I'm so glad I learned German under her", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] This is a great course if you want to learn German fast. Sylvia is a wonderful teacher and every class is fun", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] I would 100% recommend taking this course. The accelerated aspect is nothing to fear. Sylvia is fantastic and she does a great job helping you develop a strong command of the German language.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] This is very much a class where you get out what you put in. If you buy in to spending two hours today discussing German with enthusiasm, then you will learn a lot and probably enjoy yourself. Sylvia is an extremely passionate and caring teacher.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] Sylvia is a really great instructor who really wants you to be successful in learning German. You get a lot out of this course if you try hard to learn the language.", "[0.35] [Autumn 2018] Sylvia is a great teacher and really  wants you to learn. You get out as much of the course as you but in", "[0.5] [Autumn 2018] You can get so much out of this class if you put in the work. Sylvia is also an incredible teacher who really cares about and invests so much in her students.", "[0.85] [Winter 2018] It's extremely helpful, especially when taken in Berlin--will give you a greater appreciation for studying abroad. Very organized and well-taught", "[0.95] [Winter 2018] They must take it Berlin but Diana is awesome I would highly recommend choosing her. Make sure to start learning vocab since day 1 since its a huge chunk of the grade.", "[0.85] [Winter 2018] The pace in this class is very nice -- fast enough where you're definitely learning German at an accelerated rate but not overwhelming. There are lots of opportunities to evaluate your progress over the quarter.", "[0.0] [Winter 2018] Use German outside of Class and really try to understand the workbook pages. Also, develop a system early for remembering the genders of the nouns.", "[0.6] [Winter 2018] great course, lots of work", "[0.8] [Winter 2018] Diana is fantastic and makes learning German quite fun. Stay on top of your vocab & homework. 20 words/night might not seem like much, but it adds up fast! Doing a little bit of Duolingo before you start can make the first couple weeks much easier.", "[0.9] [Winter 2018] TAKE IT. She's lovely and truly encourages you to participate. It is an intense course, but it is definitely worth it.", "[0.45] [Winter 2018] Put effort into the class, and you'll get a good amount out of it. Study your vocab and try to speak German in your day to day life.", "[0.9] [Winter 2018] Sylvia is a great person who does really want you to get better. The homework may be mostly optional but doing it helps you learn a lot better than just attending class.", "[-0.85] [Winter 2018] I would not recommend this course with Sylvia. We did not learn phrases applicable to daily life (ie we didn't learn how to navigate shopping areas or restaurants but we read a story from the 1800s). It was not clear why we were learning what we were learning on a daily basis. Notes were not uniform, we were told about exams the day before and exam dates we were given at the start were changed a few days before it. In general, it was difficult to gauge expectations for work and feedback was not written clearly. At times, the prof communicated with one student (the same one each time) for a majority of the class.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2017] Diana is an unbelievably understanding and exceptional teacher", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] It's great, super organized, and really worth it to give it a good effort.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2017] Take. This. Class. With. Diana. She has been the best foreign language prof I've had. Class was fun and personalized, always felt prepared for tests, fair grading and critiques. German courses in Berlin overall do not emphasize speaking as much and so you should take it upon yourself to try and speak German outside of class, likely with your host parents. Putting effort into the class is very rewarding, your skills at the end definitely will show it.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2017] Pay attention and trust Diana--she knows what she's doing!!!", "[0.7] [Autumn 2017] It is necessary to take this when in Berlin if you do not have previous German experience, but it is a fantastic course", "[0.6] [Autumn 2017] Sylvia is awesome", "[0.0] [Autumn 2017] take it", "[0.75] [Winter 2017] Diana is an amazing teacher, you will be lucky to have her.", "[0.5] [Winter 2017] Ich liebe Diana! This course was great. You don't really have a choice, but make the most of it!", "[0.35] [Winter 2017] A must-take if you're in Berlin. Literally. Also it's pretty necessary to speak German if you want to be able to understand the culture and not just feel like a tourist.", "[0.0] [Winter 2017] Do all of the exercises in the workbook- will make it so you barely even need to study for the tests. And memorize your 20 vocab words every day.", "[0.85] [Winter 2017] Sylvia is an amazing professor! She is very organized, and keeps the class engaged and excited to learn. My German went from zero to being able to have fluid conversations.", "[0.0] [Winter 2017] n/a", "[0.95] [Winter 2017] Sylvia is fantastic. She does give a lot of homework, but it really is excellent practice so I recommend staying on top of it.", "[0.5] [Winter 2017] Be prepared to spend more time on a class than you have ever before. It may be consuming, but just buy into it, and it is worth it. Grammar comes easy--just learn a lot of vocabulary and try to practice speaking whenever possible!", "[0.65] [Winter 2017] Sylvia is the nicest/best teacher I've ever had. You'll love it!", "[0.8] [Autumn 2016] Great way to learn German, and learning in-country makes practicing much easier", "[0.85] [Autumn 2016] Learning German can be really fun if you put some effort into it! I think there's a bit of this mentality that you should just explore the city and not put any effort into classes, but the classes can be really great too!", "[0.3] [Autumn 2016] Make sure to study you vocabulary and complete all of the homework", "[0.0] [Autumn 2016] Language classes are all what you make it, so take the time to learn the topics, ESPECIALLY if you are taking it in Germany where you can apply your new learnings.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2016] Jochen is a great teacher. Very friendly, funny, engaging, and encouraging. You are really going to get out of this course what ever you put in, and it is definitely worth pushing yourself because it will make your experience in Berlin that much better.", "[-0.65] [Autumn 2016] It is essential that you keep detailed notes for all the different topics covered in the future. Because it moves so fast you will move on to another topic before you have mastered the first and without good references you will forget and confuse previous topics.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2016] This class is very fast paced, and what you get out of it is entirely up to how much you put into it. There's a lot of homework, apparently more so in this section than in the others to my knowledge, but a lot of it is also optional. I suggest doing as much of the optional work as possible, even thought it will end up being many hours worth of work, so that you can refine your German. Also, meet with Sylvia if you have any questions! She is very helpful and super nice when you do so."], "OSPBER 101A": ["[0.95] [Autumn 2022] This is a special opportunity to go, every week, to a real Berlin production. The essays greatly improve your German writing, and Karen is a great person if you're a passionate thinker/ interested in German(y). She's a treasure!", "[0.7] [Autumn 2022] Take it! You go to a play every week, and the professor is extremely engaging and knowledgeable. You learn so much about German theater, and all the themes, topics and conventions which surround it!", "[0.8] [Spring 2019] Really make the most of your meetings with Sylvia, she is a great resource to improve your German", "[0.9] [Spring 2019] Having the opportunity to attend so many plays is really amazing, but also very time consuming. Additionally, Karen talks a lot and does not give students sufficient opportunity to practice their spoken German. However, there is lots of feedback on written German, which is quite helpful.", "[1.0] [Spring 2019] Take it! It's a great opportunity to explore Berlin's theater scene, and really unmatched in terms of cultural exposure. A couple caveats: this is a big time commitment &#x2014; counting travel time and post-play discussion, each play (you see an average of one per week) will take around 5 hours. Also, this really isn't a German class &#x2014; it feels like Karen mostly wants it to be a theater class, and the German aspect is kind of tacked on. Accordingly, you'll get a lot more out of the post-play discussions in English than in-class discussions in German, and you probably shouldn't take this instead of a language class if your goal is to become more fluent. However, the weekly essays are a great way to get better at written German, and Sylvia is lovely. Definitely take your drafts and your meetings with her seriously &#x2014; it's worth it.", "[0.0] [Spring 2019] take it!", "[0.75] [Spring 2019] Karen makes hit or miss theater choices. This quarter most of the theater productions we saw weren't particularly great. I would still take the course&#x2014;it's a joy to visit and enjoy (for free!) the mecca of German theater.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2018] This class is a great introduction to contemporary German theater and way for students learning German to apply their language skills to an academic discipline as strongly linked to a city as the arts are tied to Berlin. Karen is a professor who truly cares about her students--she is extremely flexible and takes student input into account when structuring the class over the course of the quarter. While the German component of the class is not as strongly emphasized as it would be in a language class, having a weekly, one-on-one session with a German language instructor to walk through your essays with you truly does help develop a better understanding of certain grammatical nuances. Overall, the class is an excellent forum for seeing Berlin in a new way, and the performing arts definitely allow one to discern some of the guiding ethics or \"vibes\" that underlie a city's consciousness.", "[0.8] [Spring 2018] This is an incredible option if you are interested in theater! Going and seeing a new play every week is an incredible way to get to know Berlin through its theater. Highly recommend!", "[0.35] [Spring 2018] Worthwhile as a course to learn more about the culture of theater in Germany/Berlin. The different pieces have the capacity to make you think critically about different topics and ideas", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] This course is a lot of time. The plays last a long time and the discussion after even more so. Marking is not harsh and the weekly essays are a great way to improve your written German, especially thanks to Sylvia's drafting help.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2017] Professor Smith is great. He knows a lot about theater and his classes are fun and engaging. I was never very interested in theater prior to this class but I highly recommend it.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2017] I am very thankful to have taken this course with Prof. Smith - he truly made the class feel like an open discussion and topics came up organically based on what students found interesting. Workload is easy enough to not stress about it but enough so that one can reflect on the pieces they have seen. My background is in engineering and I found this course to be the experience I was looking for while I was abroad. Take it and prepare yourself for the Berlin theatrical scene", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] If you're coming to Berlin you should take this class! It's a great way to get a feel for Berlin and the culture and try something different. Matt is an incredibly knowledgeable professor and also creates a really comfortable space for people who have no experience with theater (like myself!)", "[0.9] [Spring 2017] Reading the texts before the plays is worth it. The course is a great way to learn more about German culture and explore a really exciting arts scene.", "[0.05] [Spring 2017] Pick this class if you have to take a class beyond the 21-level. It is much more entertaining and less stressful than the other option.", "[0.6] [Spring 2017] It is not much work and it is a great way to go out and experience a cultural aspect of the city.", "[0.9] [Spring 2017] Take it!  The theater might not be to your taste (Berlin theater is famous for being wacky and experimental), it's a great, once in a lifetime opportunity (you see a play once a week).  Don't be nervous if your German isn't totally perfect!  You will still get a lot out of the class.  ALSO, do Tintenfisch (make your own class play) if you get the chance!", "[0.25] [Spring 2017] You'll see lots of quirky plays and the essays are a little annoying, class is fairly boring, but it's a cool way to see a part of Berlin culture.", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] This course is interesting and it is very rewarding to be able to attend so many plays in such a short period of time. However, this course also requires a fair amount of independent work and does take a fair amount of time, especially with plays that take place outside of class time.", "[0.4] [Spring 2017] It was a lot of weird plays.

Almost every class session is structured about a different topic of contemporary relevance and then consists of a student presentation and discussion thereafter. There is not much direct lecturing, so be sure to pay attention to the thoughts of your peers. Furthermore, pay attention to events in the news if you want to be able to meaningfully contribute to class discussions. Especially if you don't have a very strong background in politics or close understanding of current events, this class will likely push you out of your comfort zone.

The discussions were a lot of fun and (most of) the movies were great as well.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] A great class to learn about German history through film.

It's honestly a waste of time. The professor babbles during the entire movie, to the point where you can't concentrate. It's infuriating.

It's a very unique and hard-to-come-by experience.", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] Definitely take it if it's in winter quarter. The Berlinale is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Sometimes the discussion sections can be a bit suffocating particularly because people are just asserting their opinions like facts and in reality we all really don't know much about film and it's intersection with German history. But the class is overall very cool.", "[0.7] [Winter 2019] TAKE THIS COURSE!!! You will learn the complex nature of Germany's history through the eyes of film.

The films were really interesting and offered a really good nuanced view of Berlin's history, especially the DDR period.", "[0.75] [Winter 2019] This course is an excellent window into thinking critically about film. I would recommend for any student who wants to develop perspectives in film history and analysis beyond mainstream cinema.", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] a genuine interest in film goes a long way in this course -- don't take it just to fulfill some humanities requirement but because you want to gain an excellent introduction to 20th century German history via the art of film", "[0.85] [Winter 2019] Really fun! Dr. Kramer is extremely knowledgeable and a great educator.", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] If you like watching movies, this is a really interesting course to both see different films and to learn more about German perspectives/history.

Doing the supplemental readings is extremely helpful in gaining insights about how the film can be tied to the context of time.", "[0.55] [Winter 2017] This course is very interesting, especially if you take it in the winter quarter with Berlinale.

I don't think this course was very helpful to me to develop my German skills or to delve into new material or critiques. If you want to take this course, be prepared for a large amount of work (especially relative to the theater class)--particularly daunting are the 2-page (but often more) weekly essays, which have to be reviewed and corrected. The readings are interesting, but in-class discussions can be frustrating because they often tend to be more lectures from Wolf than class discussions. If you do end up taking this course, I'd recommend encouraging Wolf to accept student feedback throughout the quarter (about format or content of the class)--I think the default tends to be about procedurally getting through the material rather than ensuring to what degree students have meaningfully engaged with the material. I'd say that this course by and large took up more of my week than any other course that I took in Berlin, and I wish that I had found a better balance between enjoying the city and doing work for this class--you should feel empowered to be conscious and critical of the workload earlier in the quarter before it transforms into the norm at the end.", "[0.7] [Spring 2018] The course is interesting and informative to anyone who wants to learn more about sport culture in Germany and beyond. Going to the sports games was a cool experience. Be prepared for A LOT of work and time spent on this. I spent more time on this course than any other 5 unit at Stanford and probably without a grade that reflects the effort I feel I have put in.", "[0.55] [Spring 2018] Unless you have no other option, do not take this class. The amount of time it requires to do well will actively take away from your ability to live in Berlin.", "[0.65] [Spring 2017] Be prepared for lots of listening comprehension because the lectures are fast and solely in German. It is very interesting if you do not know much about sports in general and want to learn more.", "[0.85] [Spring 2017] Definitely tends to focus more on the cultural part, philosophy, than on sports. Significant amount of reading. Getting to go to the games is cool; also able to audit to see the games. Have to take a sport class at the German university; make sure to take a team based sport, it will make the next to last essay much more manageable.I liked the ones we had. It was nice to see the difference between male and female soccer. Seeing how German basketball differs from American basketball was interesting. And handball is something most Americans don't know about but a major part of German culture, so it was important to see."], "OSPBER 19": [], "OSPBER 198D": [], "OSPBER 198F": [], "OSPBER 198H": [], "OSPBER 199A": [], "OSPBER 199B": [], "OSPBER 199C": [], "OSPBER 199D": [], "OSPBER 199F": [], "OSPBER 199G": [], "OSPBER 199H": [], "OSPBER 199J": [], "OSPBER 199K": [], "OSPBER 199L": [], "OSPBER 199M": [], "OSPBER 2Z": ["[0.95] [Autumn 2022] A very time intensive but rewarding class. Diana, the professor, was one of the best I've had and made learning the language very fun and manageable. Would recommend over doing a language classes at Stanford.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2022] Diane is by far the best language teacher I've ever had!!", "[0.55] [Autumn 2022] This is a wonderful way to learn German, especially with Diana.", "[0.35] [Autumn 2022] Take initiative and get extra materials from the instructor to supplement the course if you'd like to learn quicker.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] This is the best language course I have ever taken. The teacher, Diana Boebe, was incredible and effortlessly interwove entertaining class subjects with intensive vocabulary and grammar learning. I feel so much more confident in my language abilities after this course. It is a must take opportunity:)", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Sylvia is absolutely incredible. Her teaching style is not too formulaic which allows for focus on topics that the students wish to train themselves on. I also appreciate her lecture style in that it involves tons of conversation. I truly enjoyed this course and feel that my German has enhanced so much since the beginning of the quarter. Wonderful instructor!!!", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] Expect 2 hours of lecture plus around 2 hours of homework everyday. In this class, you learn approximately 500 words, read 3 short books/plays, and watch excerpts from a simple German movie. It's awesome to learn material in class and then see them being used in restaurants or in the street. Usually there is a quiz every week. It is easy to fall behind on grammar, adjective endings, cases, etc. so factor this outside learning into your homework. Sylvia is a good teacher, always open to review and answer questions.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Sylvia is an extremely experienced language teacher. Her lessons are structured so that we have ample time to practice speaking and conversation while also learning important grammar structures. She assigns sentence writing homework every day, which she also grades every day. That is a huge time commitment for her, and I deeply appreciate her investing time to do that. Her and Diana, the other language instructor, also have a grammar handbook that is better than any other material that I could find online, and infinitely better than the Motive textbook. Her Protokoll structure is helpful, and I appreciate how the vocabulary that we have to learn are words that have come up in class and have real-life utility.  My German has exponentially improved after taking this class, and I have Sylvia to thank for that.", "[0.3] [Winter 2022] It is about a 4 hour daily commitment when including the 2 hour class and daily homework. You will definitely learn a lot and it helps to learn German while studying in Germany but be prepared for the class to take up a lot of your time. All the language classes were early in the morning here which can be a bit annoying given you need to commute to the center", "[0.85] [Spring 2022] Definitely recommend it! Sylvia is a gem of a professor! She's such a sweet and understanding person, and you can tell she really really cares about not only your learning and academic advancement, but also your general well-being. You get out what you put into the class, so ask lots of questions and go out of your way to talk to people in German on a daily basis (i.e. your host family, German friends/students you meet, baristas, etc. - it's really hard to improve otherwise)!", "[0.55] [Spring 2022] Make sure you stay on top of the daily vocabulary!", "[0.8] [Autumn 2019] Ask the instructor about clear deadlines because it can be confusing at times. Beyond the course, it it important to speak as much German as you can with your host. I felt that when I supplemented what I learned in class with talking with my host, I greatly improved my speaking abilities.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2019] Do your vocab every day so you don't end up with 200 to do the day before an exam", "[0.6] [Autumn 2019] It's a lot of units, so be prepared to work mainly with vocabulary lists and journal writing. Course could delve more into practice exercises to solidify grammar concepts better.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2019] Definitely take this while abroad, it's really useful to start out study abroad with some knowledge, but you won't learn the language as well by just taking it on campus", "[0.85] [Spring 2019] This class wouldn't have been the same if it weren't for Jochen. He is a very caring person and an excellent teacher. Everyone looked forward to his class every single day. Would highly recommend.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] Jochen is one of my favorite teachers ever -- he's incredibly funny, knows how to teach German in an informative but fun way, and cares deeply about each of his students. This will be a hard class (2hrs every morning is tough), but it is so worth it", "[0.85] [Spring 2019] Not too bad for an eight unit course, this is definitely the best time to take a language class", "[0.1] [Spring 2019] If you want to learn German, this is it.", "[0.05] [Spring 2019] We maybe used the coursebook maybe 3 times. A lot of it was self directed (we would say what we want to learn and we would learn it) but therefore lacked a bit of organization", "[-0.3] [Spring 2019] Sylvia is a great teacher, but our class had significantly more work than the other German section which was often frustrating. A lot of this work was busy work too", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] The class is challenging and requires a lot of work, which is unfortunate because you'll be abroad. The diaries and vocab can become a grind but are useful.   The professor is excellent though and really recommend him. Very nice and understanding.", "[0.55] [Winter 2019] Jochen is a very fun and knowledgeable instructor.", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] The course really improves your grammar, and gives you some exposure to German literature, which was great. We took a field trip to Leipzig that was fun and a great way to interact with what we had read about. Expect the class to be fairly different from the language classes at Stanford campus, as it's not structured to follow a book or set schedule, and is instead driven by a collection of loose topics.", "[0.75] [Winter 2019] this is definitely an 8 unit course if you put the time expected into reviewing vocabulary/grammar on a regular basis and practicing in everyday situations -- if you are serious about improving your German in the short time you have here, don't overload your schedule with units", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] Jochen is a fantastic teacher and deeply cares about his students. Class is always fun and engaging, and Jochen goes out of his way to involve everyone. I highly recommend taking German with Jochen if given the chance.", "[0.4] [Winter 2019] Jochen's an excellent German teacher. The class is partly directed by the topics you're interested in, so if there's anything you'd like to know or use specifically, you can bring it up (It does make \"studying ahead of time\" probably impossible, though.)  It's also a good technique to study vocab daily as you'll need to memorize 950  words by the end of the quarter (which is manageable but difficult and requires lots of practice).", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] I loved this course, and I mostly loved it because of Jochen. He is a fantastic teacher that is incredibly understanding and wants us to enjoy learning German. We read a lot of great books and articles as well.", "[0.0] [Spring 2018] you learn as much as you put in", "[0.8] [Spring 2018] Jochen is an awesome German teacher and although the class is intense and moves at a very fast pace, you will come out of the class with a much better grasp of the German language.", "[0.0] [Spring 2018] Take the time to review everything in class because there isn't much reviewing done in class.", "[0.9] [Spring 2018] Make the most out of it! Jochen is an amazing teacher and you can learn so much in his class so enjoy it and enjoy Germany", "[0.35] [Spring 2018] This class seems to be very conversation based and does not have much structure. If you learn best in a class where there are actual lectures, more organized teaching of topics, and more guidance in general, this class might be more difficult.", "[0.9] [Spring 2018] Jochen is amazing! You'll learn so much German and have a super fun time!", "[0.6] [Spring 2018] Take it wich Jochen, he was an amazing teacher!", "[-0.2] [Spring 2018] The tests are really hard and very long. Keep up with your vocab and journals. You ultimately get out of it what you put in", "[0.85] [Spring 2018] It's a pretty important part of your Berlin experience. Sylvia is an awesome teacher who really points out your weaknesses and helps you fix them.", "[1.0] [Spring 2018] This class can be a decent amount of work (not too much) and waking up for a 9:30 everyday  can be a lot, but it is also a great class. You learn a lot in a very short amount of time. Sylvia is great and really cares about her students. She provides a great atmosphere and keeps the class really organized. You'll get out of the class what you put in.", "[0.9] [Spring 2018] This is a wonderful course to take while in Berlin! I had so much fun and learned so much. Sylvia is one of the best professors I've had.", "[0.8] [Spring 2018] Great course! Your German will improve a ton!", "[0.4] [Spring 2018] I would discourage it. I found the course confusing. Some simple grammar questions were not answered for many weeks, and I found that the course's lessons sometimes confused me more than helped me learn. Also, It took an extraordinary amount more time than any other 8 units I had taken, which (given the fact that it is German course taught in Berlin) prevented me from being able to speak to local german speakers, which I found very frustrating and reduced my ability to learn.  I also found the test to lesson ratio best described by the adjective \"disciplinary\", and this took away from my interest in gaining fluency in German by reducing learning time, adding a great deal of stress before and during the very long tests, and forcing me to focus on learning specific parts of German, rather than the parts I was struggling with.", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] There's a lot of work but definitely necessary to keep practicing German. Keep on top of studying vocabulary. Sylvia is wonderful and tries her best to help us learn.", "[0.0] [Spring 2018] It's a lot of work, esp because it is every day and is incredibly fast paced", "[-0.45] [Spring 2017] Lots of fun. Mornings can be tough, but there's really no other better time. You'll get out of it as much as you put in through speaking and writing, so be prepared to work.", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] Take this course with Sylvia! She was an absolutely amazing, sweet, and supportive teacher who really helped me vastly improve my German. She gives a good mix of new grammar, practical vocab for getting around Berlin, and speaking practice with each lesson, and she is willing to work directly with students to improve them bit by bit!", "[0.4] [Spring 2017] Engage in the classroom to get a lot of practice with the language. Be willing to try the language as much as you can!", "[0.9] [Spring 2017] Sylvia is an excellent teacher, very dedicated to the course. Your German will improve a lot. Leave space in your schedule, though, as this course assigns a huge amount of homework. Just one Berlin Center course on top of this should be enough.", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] The course moves quickly, but you will learn a great deal. Classroom instruction is helpful for learning grammar, but try to speak as much German as possible outside of the class to actually improve your skills. I found that my German improved quicker if I talked to people in German regularly outside of class, even if it was texting other native speakers.", "[0.45] [Spring 2017] You learn a good bit of German and Berlin is the place to do that. It's quite a bit of class time every day though", "[0.85] [Spring 2017] Great course. The strength of the course is in the fact that is very strongly based in the students Berlin experiences and questions.", "[0.75] [Winter 2017] I think that this is a great way to learn German. It is an extremely fast pace, but since you are abroad, it is very helpful in learning the language.", "[0.0] [Winter 2017] The first half of the course teaches a ton of grammar but this allows the second half to be more student-driven in terms of which activities the class does. Don't fall behind on vocab because that makes it a chore.", "[0.55] [Winter 2017] Jochen is a fantastic professor and really understands where students are in their learning process.", "[0.2] [Winter 2017] Stay on top of the vocab! You're supposed to learn 15 words a day, so make a Quizlet from the beginning and keep at it because once you fall behind it's hard to catch up again", "[0.4] [Winter 2017] Would highly recommend. What you learn and grow in as far as German is concerned, is proportional to how much effort you put in."], "OSPBER 21B": ["[0.9] [Autumn 2017] Take it!!! Maria is so sweet and a fantastic teacher. She also brings tea and baked goods to class :)", "[0.6] [Autumn 2017] Maria is a great teacher. She bakes you cakes and gives you tea for some of the discussions in German", "[0.9] [Autumn 2017] Only take this class if you need to, otherwise it's a lot more helpful to just go have conversations with people and watch German TV/listen to German radio on your own and with your host family. The grammar book for the class is phenomenal though, and super cheap.   Maria tends to spend a lot of time working on translating German into English rather than perfecting our German. She also repeats grammar lessons. The class just moves way too slowly (even on a minute to minute basis) to be worth it.", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] Diana is AMAZING. She's so cool, always engaged, and really knows her stuff. I learned so much about Berlin while learning German, and she's great to ask for advice. Her daily protocols are also a great way to keep organized, especially since everything gets a bit crazy when abroad", "[0.35] [Spring 2017] It's a well taught course whether you are going through the typical sequencing at Stanford or learned German as a child and want to formalize your grammar.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2016] Take it!!

You will learn so much in a great environment.", "[-0.1] [Spring 2019] TAKE THIS COURSE! But only if Diana is teaching it. She is a goddess. This is one of the most worthwhile (if not THE most valuable) course I took this quarter.", "[0.75] [Spring 2018] Diana is a great teacher. She makes sure to cover what we feel we need to work on as well as what she thinks. Only criticism is that this is way too much work for a 2 unit class and should be made to 3 to reflect the workload and so it can count towards a German Studies minor. You have weekly homework comprising of sentences and reading or an essay plus corrections. Additionally there is a final worth 30% of your grade.", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] Definitely take it!

Just do.", "[0.85] [Spring 2017] This is an amazing class and very well taught.

A wonderful person and instructor.  With the class, you definitely get what you put into it.  Favorite class this quarter.", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] I couldn't recommend this course more highly! Diana is an incredible teacher, easily the best German teacher I've ever had in my four years of learning the language. She is personable, passionate, and unbelievably knowledgeable.

Mattias was also just incredibly knowledgeable.", "[0.4] [Winter 2022] A nice way to learn about the city of Berlin in an interactive manner. Matthias discusses things you wouldn't normally notice.

The class is also barely any work - just one small, low-stakes paper at the end.", "[0.8] [Spring 2022] Great way to explore famous sights in Berlin and learn more history and details. Matthias is very nice, and knows a lot about the city!", "[0.4] [Autumn 2021] yes", "[0.45] [Autumn 2021] It's very interesting, but some field trips were just lectures where we stood in one place and didn't get to see much of the location.

Martin is a great guide to the city. It's really nice to have a scheduled opportunity each week to go see important sights in Berlin, and to hear about their history from such a knowledgable guide.

ABSOLUTELY RECOMMENDED. Matthias knows literally everything - seriously, I challenge you to ask him a question that he doesn't know the answer to. The field trips were all really interesting, and the most valuable thing for me was that we were often hearing narratives behind the history/architecture/art that we would've never found out on our own - details about why things were designed the way they were, the historical/artistic context, etc. And you get to go into all of these museums/locations for free! There's honestly no good reason not to take it, 11/10 recommend.", "[0.85] [Winter 2019] This course is an excellent way to experience Berlin through a historical lens.

Martin tells fantastic stories about everywhere we go and he's really invested in making sure we enjoy the trips.

It also takes up no time and was really fun!", "[0.4] [Autumn 2018] you'll end up definitely learning about Berlin", "[0.8] [Autumn 2018] Martin is great at relaying the history of the city during the walking tours. Tours are quite enjoyable although sometimes feel a bit long.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2018] Really great way to get an extra unit and Martin is a great tour guide! Highly recommend taking this course to help get oriented in Berlin and learn about the city", "[0.85] [Spring 2018] It's a bit of an annoying time commitment, but if you really want to learn more about the city take it. Plus Matthias is very knowledgeable, and answers pretty much every question you ask him well.", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] This class is awesome, you will learn so much great and interesting stuff about Berlin. Matthias excels at teaching you about the history, architecture, and art of the city and answering all the questions you have before you can even ask them. I would highly recommend talking to him and asking questions in the interim periods between sites.", "[0.9] [Spring 2018] Take it! Matthias is a really great teacher and he knows so much about Berlin. Every class he dropped so many wisdom bombs and made it all very interesting. Ask him lots of questions; he can answer so many.", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] Wonderful class, definitely take it! You'll get to know Berlin way better and Matthias is amazing! Each tour I came back knowing so much more and seeing new areas I wouldn't have gone before", "[0.85] [Spring 2018] This was a great course to get out into the city and learn about its history. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who comes to Berlin!", "[0.6] [Spring 2018] It's a fantastic way to see the city and learn about its history and architecture. Dr. Pabsch is incredibly knowledgeable and personable - take the class!", "[0.75] [Winter 2018] Really good opportunity to learn more about the city! Absolutely take this in Berlin.", "[0.7] [Winter 2018] I would not take it for credit, I would just go to the tours that you seem interested in and if youre not interested just go visit a place that is more interesting to you.", "[0.7] [Winter 2018] It's an easy way to explore Berlin a little more than just the typical tourist attractions", "[0.0] [Winter 2018] Go even if it's cold", "[0.45] [Spring 2017] Definitely ask Matthias questions and practice your German with him!", "[0.35] [Spring 2017] Good tours of locations in Berlin you wouldn't otherwise visit. Definitely worth taking.", "[0.7] [Spring 2017] It's a field trip every week or 2 to go see some new place. Not usually the most interesting tours but it's a good way to see new things", "[0.85] [Spring 2017] Take it. Matthias is great and its an absolutely fantastic way to get to know the city", "[0.6] [Spring 2017] It is a great way to see the city and do things that you would not be able to without Stanford. For example, we got a private tour of the construction of the new palace.", "[-0.2] [Spring 2017] Listen up to Matthias when he's talking, and try to strike up conversation with him about other things going on in Berlin!", "[0.9] [Spring 2017] Take the class and actually go every week!  Matthias is wonderful and extremely knowledgable.  If you respond positively, he will respond positively back.  Take the time to talk to him as you walk places and ask specific questions that pique your interest.", "[0.5] [Spring 2017] A great way to get to see parts of the city that you probably wouldn't get the chance to otherwise; very laid back.", "[-0.2] [Spring 2017] If you don't enjoy traveling in large groups that move slowly, skip this course and go sightseeing on your own. The places you'll visit aren't the must-sees of Berlin, per se, and you'll be limited to going where the class goes (so if you pass somewhere interesting that the class isn't scheduled to visit, you'll have to return on your own).", "[0.85] [Spring 2017] Take it. Matthias is great and shows you many sights around Berlin and gives awesome details.", "[0.65] [Spring 2017] The tours involve visits to places I wouldn't have seen otherwise. Matthias is a great group leader with endless knowledge of the area and architecture. Some of the museum visits were not as interesting as walking around the city, like the Jewish Resistance Museum.", "[0.7] [Winter 2017] I highly recommend this course. It is a very small time commitment yet a very insightful look on the history of the city.", "[0.9] [Winter 2017] Definitely take it and go to all the meetings. Matthias is a great tour guide and professor and has a lot of great knowledge about the city to share with his students", "[0.75] [Winter 2017] It's a great way to see the highlights of the city as well as learn their backstory. Matthias knows a ton about the history of Berlin.", "[0.9] [Winter 2017] Great way to learn more about Berlin's culture and best sites, Matthias is great", "[0.65] [Winter 2017] Take it! Most of the places are great.", "[0.55] [Winter 2017] Listen closely to what Matthias says- he has some fascinating stories", "[0.9] [Winter 2017] Definitely recommend it. Matthias knows a lot and he does make a point of bringing you to some really cool places. If you take this class in the winter, though, make sure you're dressed warmly enough. There's a lot of standing outside in the cold.", "[0.3] [Winter 2017] Take it! Several tours are outside so during the winter months be prepared for that", "[0.9] [Winter 2017] It can seem like a burden at times, but definitely worth it if you can plan it into your schedule and then go out on Wednesday evenings with friends!", "[0.65] [Winter 2017] There's really no reason not to take this course. Matthias is great and really informative. Make sure to ask lots of questions!", "[0.65] [Winter 2017] Matthias brought us to several points of interest around the city (not always touristy), that I'd never have seen on my own - or have known about the cool history behind which."], "OSPBER 31": ["[0.95] [Autumn 2019] I didn't like most of the concerts, but I'm glad I was in the class because it pushed me to go to a variety of concerts.

It's a nice way to experience Berlin and its rich music scene. I think it's still worth it for all the free, cool concerts, but as a heads up- not every concert is something I would've actually liked to attend on my own (about half were Opera, classical, or contemporary classical). Leah is not very accommodating if you must miss a concert. You need to attend every concert, or attend a make up concert and write a reflection for any concert you miss. Four of our concerts were the nights before German examinations, so hopefully in the future Leah can do a better job of coordinating with the German teachers to prevent this. Literally every German test we had (except the final) was the day after a concert.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] The concerts are fun and interesting, but I wish we got to see how the music connects to Berlin as a city. There could be more historical/modern context to the music and its relationship to Berlin. Also, attendance is very strict, but you still get a cool experience. My favorite event was the contemporary concert.", "[-0.6] [Autumn 2019] Very poorly led. Teacher was very rude and lacked empathy and understanding. Overly strict and made the class very unpleasant. I would highly recommend that this class be discontinued if the instructor remains the same.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2019] Good opportunities to see concerts, though the concerts are hit or miss.", "[0.05] [Autumn 2019] This class is interesting because you get to see many different types of music. But the events tended to be the night before exams or evaluations, which was tough.", "[-0.2] [Autumn 2019] The concerts this quarter weren't great and they tended to be in the middle of the week (often before tests). It's too much of a time commitment for a 1 unit", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] I would recommend because Berlin's music scene is so unique! It's a very cool chance to see the city from a musical perspective. Leah is very knowledgeable but sometimes expects a higher musical education level than you actually might have. Really enjoyed the discussions though. A solid class.", "[0.25] [Winter 2019] If you're planning to go to cultural and music events in Berlin anyway, this is a good class. Some people didn't take it because they wanted to travel on weekends, but it really didn't constrain me that much.", "[0.0] [Winter 2019] music shows you so much about the history, culture, and beliefs of a society -- ask a lot of questions and bounce opinions off of Leah and your classmates", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] Take it! You get free concert tickets to a huge variety of music, some of which you probably wouldn't even have considered outside of the class beforehand. Leah's really nice and certainly knows what she's talking about in discussions.  Some of the concerts fall on weekends, and blocking out a weekend or two from travel can certainly be less than ideal. For my quarter, though, only one weekend was truly \"blocked out\" (and it was a weekend where I had to stay in Berlin anyway)."], "OSPBER 33": ["[0.7] [Winter 2022] Take it! Field trips and Charlotte\u2019s lectures give you a unique overview into understanding how Germany \u201ccomes to terms with its past\u201d, and ways in which it still struggles to do so. Charlotte is really chill, and extremely passionate and knowledgeable about the issues at hand.", "[0.45] [Winter 2022] The group discussions cover some really interesting topics and the field trips show you a side of Berlin that you might not get otherwise.", "[1.0] [Winter 2022] Charlotte is an extremely knowledgeable and personable teacher. Her class allows you to think carefully about important and super fascinating ethical and political problems that surround the Holocaust, WWII, and their processing and memorialization by Germany. I think it is critical to take this class so that you have a clearer and better informed picture of the political landscape as you are living here. I think we should be responsible residents and foreign exchange students in this way. Charlotte is also a lovely human being, who really cares about your well-being and invests time into getting to know you. I really enjoyed the class discussions, so if that could be a more significant portion of the class, it would be awesome!", "[0.6] [Winter 2022] This was my favorite course that I took in Berlin since it does a great job of taking advantage of the fact that we are in Berlin.

Timuor is an amazing teacher who is very helpful and extremely knowledgeable.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] This is a very interesting class and I definitely recommend taking it abroad. The small class size allows for a more catered learning experience and more help than you could get on campus. I really enjoyed the labs and thought they were quite interesting and creative.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] Timur is a great help during the lab, it's much better here than it would be on campus. That being said... read the course reader and review lecture slides because lecture goes by FAST and it's in the evening", "[-0.25] [Autumn 2021] You should have a background in electromagnetism of some kind. If your high school did not provide significant support in this area, you're going to be very lost. It's also really time consuming, especially if you need to be teaching yourself things that other students already know.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Timur is great, and taking it abroad is definitively way less work than taking it on campus. I think it's also easier to get a good grade abroad. It's really helpful to learn this material in a small class setting instead of a huge lab, and Timur's individual attention that he can provide you with is a huge help.  Definitely still takes a decent amount of time for an abroad course. Unless you're super interested, I wouldn't take it if you aren't required to. But if it does fulfill a requirement, definitely take it abroad instead of on campus.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2019] Take time on psets", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] Timur is a great instructor abroad for a class that is notoriously difficult on campus. Definitely take this course here in Berlin if you can!

Make sure you spend the time to fundamentally understand the material.", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] It's much better than the on campus version. Flexible instructor and small class size. Good way to get a requirement done while abroad. If you don't need it though, don't take it. It's definitely a time sink. Definitely worth it for me.", "[0.75] [Winter 2019] I liked the course a lot! Do take this course, very interesting.", "[-0.25] [Winter 2019] Timur really knows what he's talking about, and he constructs really good examples to illustrate particular insights/nuances about what you're learning. I have zero regrets taking 40M in Berlin. That said, of course, if you don't have to take it, the fact that it's in the evening means that you're much more restricted in what you can do in the evenings on weekdays, so if you want to spend more time in Berlin and don't need to take 40M, then this isn't the class for you.  1 for Timur though!", "[0.3] [Winter 2019] Taking it in winter quarter is especially difficult because there are no lecture videos to watch from Stanford so you must attend extra lecture sessions here to learn the material. The course will take up your time in Berlin but for students who much do E40 is should generally be easier here than at Stanford.", "[0.35] [Winter 2019] This course seems to be a lot easier than the on campus version! However, it's hard to gain solid understanding from lectures. Definitely try to obtain a copy of the course reader if you can and watch supplementary videos on youtube. Taking this class in Berlin is great to get the requirement done but not the best if you are looking for a deep understanding of EE fundamentals.", "[0.25] [Autumn 2018] If you are taking it in Berlin, be aware that you will not really have lecture. The instructor here fulfills the role of a TA and the lectures should be watched online.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2018] Timur is the man", "[0.65] [Autumn 2018] If you have to take E40, definitely take it while at Stanford in Berlin.

You should definitely take this course in Berlin. The class size is very small and the Prof (Timur) can help you when having problems in the lab. He is very knowledgeable.

His classes are a lot of fun", "[0.0] [Spring 2018] take the normal E40, it is supposedly a lot less work", "[0.8] [Spring 2018] This course can be a lot of time given you are abroad. That being said it is a good opportunity to complete a requirement if you need to and the center does a good job of providing the resources to do so. The schedule might be off compared to the home campus, but overall I think it is worth taking. You do learn a lot of cool stuff.", "[0.95] [Winter 2018] Take it! Timur is awesome. Make sure you know the schedule, its taught at night. Instruction is really good and Timur is very flexible and approachable. Much better than on campus.", "[0.55] [Winter 2017] Make sure to do prelabs well before the day of the lab", "[0.95] [Winter 2017] Timur time is the best time! Timur is incredible at explaining everything in a super simple way. \"In theory\" you will love his class!", "[0.85] [Winter 2017] Timur is an excellent teacher: very clear, detailed, and willing to help. I tried taking this class on campus and dropped it - I much preferred trying to take it in Berlin, where there's personal attention to the students during lectures, in lab, and with homeworks. My only complaint is the time slot. It meets three nights a week, which does seriously detract from the time you spend in Berlin, but I definitely think it was worth it to take a class for my major while abroad.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2016] Use supplemental resources available on the web. Some of the topics near the end of the course concerning AC power are better described in the reader than in lecture. Also, Khan academy has some fantastic videos explaining many of the same ideas.", "[0.1] [Autumn 2016] Make sure to utilize the help offered. There is no point in wasting a bunch of time poring over the three to four different resources for help (the reader, the optional textbook, lecture, slides... etc), or wasting hours in the lab wondering about something a TA could've helped you figure out in a second. Also be warned that the labs can easily run over 2.5 to 3 hours, so plan accordingly."], "OSPBER 50M": ["[0.75] [Autumn 2017] Ralf was great, very flexible, very organized, and very fast with returning psets. The Stanford side of this course is not very organized, however, and it was pretty frustrating at times", "[0.3] [Autumn 2017] 1. Don't expect to get the midterm back before the Change of Grading Basis deadline. The professor has to send the midterms back to campus to get graded, and then they have to be sent back. It's the last week of the quarter for me now, and I still have not gotten my midterm back. The final is only on the material since the midterm though, so at least that part is fair. 2. Watch all of the lectures and take notes on the lecture notes. The midterm and final material is based on this. You don't need much from the textbook.", "[0.95] [Spring 2017] The OSPBER E50M class involves students self-healing themselves the course via videos shot from a few years ago on campus. The class itself is a relatively poorly structured course that one should only take if required to. The course starts off somewhat strong, explaining the foundational chemistry quite well, but all too soon the class becomes a boring, irrelevant mess of vocabulary words, poorly explained phenomena, and homeworks that seem trivial and rarely help elucidate the course material. The tidbits on biomedical applications can sometimes be interesting, but they are often fairly obscure. The OSPBER class coordinator Ralf is dedicated however, but he can only really make the best of what he has. He ran various sessions to help clarify the material, and gave helpful comments for homework.", "[0.8] [Spring 2017] Ralf is an excellent mentor who does an excellent job at explaining the concepts. While the class meetings are optional, you really learn a lot from him and his very well-designed review slides.", "[0.6] [Spring 2017] Not too much work so good to get an engineering requirement out of the way.

Great way to learn about the history of Germany and Berlin, as well as architecture and art more generally. Matthias is a great professor and is happy to answer any questions students have.

Work load was super manageable (4pg midterm essay, 8pg essay, one small presentation in a museum about an artist w/out slides).", "[0.6] [Autumn 2022] Amazing course.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2021] Take it!!! Matthias is great - his lectures are so interesting and you really get know Berlin and Berlin history through the lens of an architect! Work load outside of class isn't too bad and the midterm and final papers aren't too long.", "[0.2] [Autumn 2021] It's really interesting even if you aren't an architecture student, but assignments can be difficult if you have no background in art history. Art history and art analysis are emphasized in the assignments a lot more than they are in the lectures and field trips, which make assignments feel a bit out of place and stressful. That being said, I learned a huge amount about Berlin architectural history and why it's relevant to understanding the history of Berlin in general. Field trips were also usually pretty cool.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2019] Matthias is so knowledgeable! I appreciated how this class was structured. After learning about a specific building/movement in lecture, we went as a class to see it in person. It was a really fun way to learn.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] This class has been my favorite class at Stanford so far.

It's one of the most whimsical, interesting classes I've taken at Stanford. You learn to see and understand Berlin's history through an . artistic lens: the architecture, art, and culture of the city. Matthias is a wonderful storyteller, and classes get more and more interesting, especially as you get into WWII & the Cold War era. It's beautiful to walk through Berlin and understand how its cityscape is linked and interconnected to its complex history!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] Amazing class, Matthias is super interesting and knowledgeable!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] Prof has a voice thats easy to fall asleep to (not in a bad way) so be prepared to stay awake,  content is really interesting", "[0.45] [Autumn 2019] Take it and come to all the field trips!

The work load is incredibly light (it's kind of like a two unit course) and you get to learn really interesting things about Berlin architecture. Matthias is incredible passionate and knows everything there is to know about Berlin art/architecture.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] Matthias is unbelievably knowledgeable about history and art in Berlin.

No previous architecture background required. You learn a lot and go on some pretty exciting field trips. I really enjoyed my time in this class!", "[1.0] [Autumn 2018] You get out of this class what you put into it; if you really want to immerse yourself in the architecture of Berlin, listen closely to Matthias's lectures, do the weekly readings, and engage with the course content as much as possible during the weekly excursions. You can get by in the class without doing the readings, but that will be at the expense of learning about a city with as rich of a history and architectural framework as Berlin. Matthias is extremely knowledgeable in all fields of art and architecture, and his open-ended midterms and finals are really great ways to get to pursue a topic of personal interest. Be sure to ask him questions and listen closely to the presentations on the weekly field trips--you can undoubtedly get a stronger profile of the city and feel more knowledgeable about some of its most acclaimed structures/artwork.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] Pretty easy class for 5 units (1 presentation, 2 papers), Matthias is a good teacher with a lot of passion and knowledge about architecture in Berlin.   Field trips are super cool, but lectures could be a bit dull.  If you have any interest in art or architecture, check this class out!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] Definitely take this. It's a great way to go on field trips to see many buildings around Berlin and learn about their history in the classroom. You'll also gain  cool tools to be able to analyze buildings when you travel around Europe.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] Matthias is probably the most magical teacher I've ever had at Stanford. He has the most incredible things to say about architecture and Berlin and I would love to take 1000 more classes from him.

Getting to experience the works we were discussing was very nice, and I loved going on the excursions to a diverse set of places and institutions. I do wish maybe we had more readings (they could be optional!) as I find them very nice to have as supplements to lecture, and I also wish lecture had a bit more visuals components, rather than five for the entire lecture.

Although listed as a lecture, it ended up being a discussion-heavy, seminar-style course, which I wasn't expecting. I was hoping to learn more about the EU and its function through lectures, but we only had one introductory lecture early in the quarter, after which we solely had discussions. Discussions often involved open-ended, seemingly unanswerable questions regarding the EU's function and future, and would often get derailed on tangential topics. Uli is clearly a very knowledgable expert in his field, but I didn't find his teaching style particularly effective. He mentioned that you don't need any prior knowledge of the EU or IR in general to succeed in the class, but I strongly believe you will have a much easier time participating in class and doing justice with the assignments if you do have prior exposure. The one plus was that the workload was very minimal, especially for a 5 unit class. I imagine the experience would be different in a quarter with more students enrolled, but would only recommend taking if you have an interest in (and exposure to) economics, IR, or politics in general.", "[-0.35] [Spring 2019] Uli obviously knows a lot about his field but the way he teaches it could be improved. He is an egoist and tends to be too harsh with his criticism. Discussions with him could be fun but felt uncomfortable sometimes.", "[0.9] [Spring 2019] Only take this course if you have a strong personal interest in the EU and the issues facing it, do not expect this course to spark an interest in the EU", "[0.4] [Spring 2019] Uli likes  to talk a lot and the class  does not have a lot of space for  discussion", "[0.9] [Spring 2019] Our course suffered from huge enrollment and not that many students with a genuine interest in the EU. With that in mind, my advice would be not to take this course if you don't have a preexisting interest in the EU. It's largely discussion and presentation based, so you won't learn that much about the fundamentals of how the EU works. Additionally, grading and assignments are really disorganized. However, if you are passionate about the EU to begin with, I would say this class is a great opportunity &#x2014; Uli is really knowledgeable and open to answering students' questions.", "[0.45] [Spring 2019] easy SI class", "[-0.2] [Spring 2019] Uli is an incredibly knowledgable/well-connected teacher and that in itself makes the class worth taking! However, class does get quite disorganized towards the end, likely because of the class size.", "[-0.15] [Spring 2019] Not particularly worthwhile&#x2014;I thought as a class we would go to Athens or do more class trips to explore the topic of crisis but we didn't. It was a huge disappointment, and I wish we had talked more to EU government agencies and its members as a class.", "[-0.25] [Spring 2019] EU in Crisis or Uli in Crisis? It was unclear since Uli never had an idea about how class should operate or what we were supposed to be doing. Uli is a prolific fan of the EU (but pretends not to be) and it is interesting seeing his perspective.", "[-0.25] [Spring 2018] This class might be better with a small number of people. But with a larger class the loose structure is extremely challenging. The assignments, rubrics, and grades have been unclear from the start.", "[0.35] [Spring 2018] This course for me was a huge disappointment. Perhaps it was the large class size but I didn't feel like I ended up learning anything from it. Most of class was student presentations or guest speakers (which were cool) but the professor rarely added new information. Might as well have read over the EU entry on Wikipedia than sit in this class.", "[0.8] [Spring 2018] Uli is flexible and willing to adapt to students' preferences and interests in the course; if the course can be somewhat up in the air or disorganized at the time, it covers a large topic and has a lot of opportunities for more depth and insight. Feel free to talk to Uli about your interests and work them into the class", "[0.5] [Spring 2018] It's pretty chill. Our quarter however we had like 20  people in the class so it would be difficult to talk but it was fine.", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] This course is totally disorganized. I understand that it is normally a much smaller group than this quarter but the instructor didn't seem to know what to do with us. He only attempted to lecture once and anything I learnt was from presentations given by my fellow students. Very little communication regarding the assignments. For the people in 5 units they were not aware of an additional assignment until a student asked him and communicated it to the rest of the group. Of course there's not any work other than the assignments so it's an easy 5 unit. Some of the speakers were also interesting and a good opportunity.", "[0.2] [Spring 2018] the class is kind of disorganized and can be a mess at times, but the speakers all bring very interesting perspectives. With a big class it can be hard to get your voice in during disucssions", "[0.0] [Spring 2018] Not a lot of work but won't get much out of class", "[0.9] [Spring 2018] This course is somewhat haphazardly instructed, but if you're interested in meeting important people involved in the EU is a good chance to get into that sphere.", "[0.7] [Spring 2018] This course was really disorganized and we did not accomplish ]as many of the learning goals as a class as I had hoped. Uli cares a lot about the students but didn't have enough of a structure to really get through all of the topics we could've covered had the class been more effectively structured.", "[0.65] [Spring 2018] This is an interesting course in terms of topics and you will get to hear from a lot of interesting speakers who are at the forefront of European politics.", "[0.9] [Spring 2018] Good class to take, as it will not require much of your time, and will allow you to explore Berlin. Uli presents a ton of interesting opportunities as well.", "[0.85] [Spring 2018] This class can be very interesting and you have a lot of unique opportunities to hear from interesting speakers. That being said, this quarter there were way too many students in the class, which made it disorganized and hard to manage as a class. We often times did not get through much because there were so many students. If there are too many students in the class again, I would recommend against taking it because you will likely get less out of it. It is also a very open ended class with regards to papers and such which can be good or bad depending on whether you like a lot of structure.", "[0.75] [Spring 2018] If you put in a lot of effort, this class will go well. Uli cares about getting to know his students and providing them with opportunities.", "[0.25] [Spring 2018] It's a little disorganized, since we had 30 people in the class, and so we didn't get as in depth as I would've liked. It was a good overview of general EU problems", "[0.7] [Spring 2018] Don't. Find your WAYS somewhere else. It's a relaxed class, but the time could be spent better somewhere else.", "[0.4] [Spring 2018] Lots of open discussions and felt as a result not very organized. Still, learned some interesting things", "[0.85] [Spring 2018] If you are self-motivated and interested, it's a good class. Otherwise it can be a bit boring and you won't learn all that much. Uli does a good job lowering the barrier to entry, but the class can feel pointless at times. Cool guest speakers, syllabus is dynamic.", "[0.7] [Spring 2018] This course is very self/class directed. Having a big class was definitely a challenge. Make sure you speak up!!", "[-0.35] [Spring 2018] The teaching style is very much student-led. We spent most of the quarter giving presentations. The speakers were really interesting and the class helped explain a lot more of the Will Trip. But, the organization is terrible. Don't take this class if you can't stand not having any instructions for assignments.", "[0.1] [Spring 2018] Interesting topics in class but incredibly organised with no guidelines on how to do well", "[-0.45] [Spring 2018] There's a lot of interesting material, but if the class is too large, then it gets kind of messy. So if the class is under 20 people, stay in it. If it's over 20, think twice.", "[0.7] [Spring 2018] This course was very poorly organized and I barely learnt anything. The only times I truly learnt were when other students presented. The instructions for the assignments were very vague, given last minute and not well explained. The professor likes to hear himself talk and always talks for too long.  The only reason I would recommend this class to anyone is that the workload is very little for a 4/5 unit (at least when there is a big group). Stay away from this class if you can, especially if it is big. If you take it, ask clarifications on assignments in advance.", "[0.85] [Winter 2017] The class gives students a lot of flexibility and freedom to choose what they are interested in. It is crucial to stay aware of what is happening in the current news, and to incorporate them into discussions about how it can affect the future of the European Union.", "[0.6] [Winter 2017] This is a great course in getting an overview understanding on how the EU works. It is mainly based on class discussions on current events, which increases your awareness of current international relations.", "[0.9] [Winter 2017] Take the course! Uli does a great job of catering to student interests and make the class what YOU want it to be. He is also well-connected and helps so many students find what they are interested in.", "[0.45] [Winter 2017] The class is more german in its instruction - very open ended, lesson plans fluid and dependent on the news. If that sounds good, it is, and if not, it won't be", "[0.85] [Winter 2017] Uli basically hooks you up with whatever you want. If you want to learn about some random topic concerning some very small part of the EU, chances are Uli can find you an expert in the field or policy maker on the ground for you to talk to. The way he explains complex topics regarding EU policy to someone with almost no background (like me!) is incredible. The classes sometimes become a debate which is a ton of fun. You also get a ton of flexibility with your projects and support if you have trouble finding resources. Take this class! You'll learn a ton :)", "[-0.1] [Winter 2017] Uli is incredibly knowledgable about the EU and international issues, and if you're serious about learning from his class you'll get a lot out of it."], "OSPBER 77": ["[0.85] [Autumn 2022] Matthew is a great teacher who is very understanding and great at facilitating conversation between students. I would recommend this class but make sure to start the soon essays soon (they can sneak up on you fast!)", "[0.65] [Autumn 2022] Matt is very nice, smart, interesting, and a good teacher, but the class isn't too high-level. However, if you don't know much about political thought, you could probably learn quite a bit. \nThe whole program needs deeper classes for more experienced humanities students, but the demand just may not be there.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2022] Take the course! I learned a lot, but Matthew is a tough grader so you have to work hard to excel", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] The course is quite geared towards beginners but still offers the potential for great depth for students more experienced with political theory. Begin thinking about your final report topic early and consult Dr. Stephen about it to hone in on an interesting angle.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] This is an interesting class and very intro friendly. The teacher is incredibly knowledgable and brings up interesting points. It is a bit focussed on top level stuff, so if you have an IR or Philosophy background it will be rather repetitive.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2019] Do the readings!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] It's a great introduction to IR with many of the core readings and ideas covered. The reading is fairly light, yet quite interesting. The course sometimes falls below its potential to connect IR theory with events in German history. Also, Matthew is very knowledgable and can give loads of cool input and feedback, but he is not necessarily the most engaging lecturer. So be active and participate to get the most out of this class!", "[-0.3] [Autumn 2019] Highly discussion-based. Good for students who have never taken IR, but can be intimidating if there are a mix of IR majors and students with no IR experience. Class is very theory based. The course does not discuss as much about Germany/Berlin as hoped. Course discussions often include blanket statements that could use more evidencing.", "[0.6] [Spring 2019] Take it. He's a great instructor and genuinely wants you to learn.", "[-0.65] [Spring 2019] The grading is a little bit weird, so I would probably take EU in Crisis instead if I was worried about GPA. This was an interesting course though, it's hard to pick between the two.", "[0.75] [Spring 2018] This class is very interesting! It is in a seminar structure and very reading heavy.

This class was not only very informative in terms of learning the topics international relations, the discussions are very open and interesting.", "[0.75] [Spring 2018] Definitely worthwhile, even for current IR students. Went over a decent amount of IR basics with more in depth analysis of certain topics with lots of discussion among students about different cases. Looks at current events and group (with teacher) speculation", "[0.9] [Spring 2018] This was a super fun and interesting course to take while in Berlin - would recommend!", "[0.4] [Spring 2018] You really learn a lot from this class. The small classroom setting allows for active participation from all students and you can hear many different perspectives.", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] Very well taught class. The reading can be a bit dense. It is generally expected that you will do it and the class is more valuable if you have. It's a great opportunity to learn about IR if you've never done it or to consolidate and strengthen your knowledge if you are an IR major. Definitely recommend it & the workload is manageable.

Fabian is very knowledgable and an engaging lecturer. The reading is super light, which is maybe the main weakness of the course because it's mostly news articles. But the lectures are detailed and go into a fair amount of depth without being overly challenging to people who havent had much econ before. Be careful whether you do it for 4 or 5 units. The 5 unit version includes a big research paper at the end, which makes it more like a 6-7 unit class.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2019] For 4 units the course is pretty light on work and a great introduction to Germany's position in a globalized world. heard for 5 units, it is much work.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2019] This course gives a great overview of globalization and Germany's economy. The readings are interesting. There's an option for an extra 11 page research paper, but I wouldn't do it unless you need the extra unit because there's not a lot of guidance on it and the workload became a lot at the end.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2019] Excellent course! Fabian is phenomenal at teaching about globalization and connecting it to relevant examples seen in the modern German economy. Essay grading is tough, so be prepared to put in significant work. 4 units is ideal. 5 units requires an entire extra research paper and presentation which actually feels more like 6-7 units.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2019] This class is a great one to take if you're interested in globalization, international trade, or the German economy. Fabian is very knowledgeable and partakes in interesting discussions. It is pretty accessible whether or not you have a background in Economics, although it certainly helps. The class workload is very manageable for the 4 units option, but 5 units requires a research paper and presentation which can be a lot of work, but fun and rewarding if worked on throughout the quarter.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2018] Take it!

I really enjoyed Fiorenza's teaching, she is a very kind and accomodating instructor, and often teaches material that goes beyond standard language competency and touches on more contemporary issues within Italian society, which I really appreciated.

You learn a lot by only speaking Italian in class and going out and speaking the language to waiters, vendors, your host family, etc. The class being entirely in Italian really helps you learn fast, but the pace is still very manageable.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2019] You definitely learn Italian a lot faster when you're in Italy. The way Fiorenza ordered the sections made a lot more sense when it comes to getting by and actually living in Florence. However, changing the sections around wasn't always very organized and many times I didn't know what was happening, what the homework was, or what to study for quizzes. Nonetheless, this course is definitely something you should take (also you have to) since you get a lot of practice speaking, listening, reading, and writing in Italian.

It was frustrating that we were basically doing the exact same things as the 1A class and having more to learn than them.

Every day, I am constantly impressed by her dedication, preparation, and enthusiasm for our class. Every minute in Giulia's class is well-used: I feel like I have learned more in 50 minutes of Giulia's class than I have in a week of other language classes I have taken. Giulia also works hard to create content that is engaging, even going above and beyond by creating fun learning games and competitions and rewarding the winners with candy (and even though we are all college students, we get really excited by candy). I found myself looking forward to coming to class every day, and Giulia was always available to help me out during her office hours and never made me feel like any of my questions (however basic) were silly. Additionally, her tests were well suited to the content, and I found that I was given a lot of direction on how to study and be prepared for our assessments. The pace of the class was perfect, I never felt rushed but we learned a significant amount of materials, even going into the Imperfect  tense. I have been able to communicate with people in Italy given the skills I learned in Giulia's class. I could not give Giulia a more sparkling review, I highly recommend her as an instructor and I hope she continues with the Stanford program!", "[0.45] [Spring 2017] This course will teach you as much as you are willing to learn.

Frankly, given how useless Italian is becoming relative to other languages I'm really glad with the amount I learned. Fiorenza is the GOAT and an all-around boss.

I would recommend not to miss this class, not only for the incredible films you will get to watch, but so as to not miss out on professor Campani's wealth of knowledge on this art form. She does an incredible job of discussing film through an academic lens, one that allows you to explore societal and cultural connotations. This class has truly helped me to appreciate film even more, and I think even if you are casually interested in film, it is a class that is worth taking.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2021] Treat the films you watch in the course as literary works, but also do the readings though!

Though many of the movies are in Italian (with subtitles), I felt perfectly equipped to watch and understand them with an analytical lens. We only had 5 students in the class, so classes were heavily discussion-based, which I really enjoyed. All the themes we discussed were engaging and very applicable to the films of the week. Professor Campani is a dedicated and caring professor who genuinely cares about your learning as a student. Be aware that you have to watch the movies outside of class, which is not an insignificant time commitment, but very doable.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2019] This was the best course I took in Florence. If you are willing to commit to watching the movies/doing the work, this course will reward you with a new perspective on cinema.

Linda is a true gem, and I guarantee you'll emerge from the class having learned a lot about not only food in film, but about Italian film as a whole.

Learning about films in the context of their history with relation to food was very interesting. I would have liked to see more mandatory readings on filmic elements and rhetoric, but understand that might make the class a bit too broad. All of the movies selected were great, and I had not seen many of them before. Class discussion was engaging and informative.

It will literally change your view about art and you will learn so much!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] Take this class! Professor Verdon is a wonderful professor, and knows so much about art history and the Florentine Renaissance. Being on your feet for a 3 hour lecture can get a bit rough, but being able to see the pieces in person and hearing Professor Verdon talk about them is so worth it. I will say, the art history papers can be a bit rough if you've never written about art history before, but a lot of resources are provided for you and Eleanor is a wonderful TA.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] Unfortunately, Verdon is retiring, so I cannot speak to the quality of future classes. However, I will say that, if you have the chance to take a class on Renaissance art while in the birthplace of the Renaissance, you should really consider it. Standing for 3 hours at a time might not seem difficult, but boy is it challenging, so be sure to wear comfortable shoes and come well-hydrated, well-fed, and well-caffeinated, and don\u2019t be too hard on yourself if you don\u2019t have an attention span that lasts the whole class. That said, considering taking this because, honestly, when in Rome (ehem Florence).\nAlso, Eleanor is a gem of a human and an heck of a TA! We seriously don\u2019t deserve her! She\u2019s amazing!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] This course was extremely well taught! Professor Verdon is a very animated, engaging lecturer who is extremely knowledgeable about the Renaissance in Florence. It was really cool to see the pieces we were talking about, and the content was laid out in a chronological, easily digestible format. The papers helped me dive deeper into specific pieces, and Eleanor (the TA) was a great help in answering any questions, guiding us through the writing process, and providing direction on where to look for more information. This was a great introduction to art history, and I cannot recommend it more!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] Please take it! This class is the highlight of my study abroad in Florence. All suggested sites for this class can be reimbursed by Stanford and they are literally almost every art history site in Florence! I enjoyed the Renaissance arts and gained an in-depth knowledge like never before. TRULY LIFE CHANGING", "[0.75] [Autumn 2022] Eleanor is splendid as a TA, and Professor Verdon knows so much about the world of art history. I highly recommend.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] I found the lectures to be very long, very dry, and a bit disconnected from our written assignments. However, Verdon is immeasurably wise and Eleanor was a phenomenal TA and was incredibly thoughtful and caring about making sure we thoroughly understood the class concepts. I\u2019d still recommend taking this course as it is a great way to see Florence and the art of the city, however, I would lower your expectations and go in a bit more realistically.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] Professor Verdon was a joy to listen to lecture during classes, it is a shame that this is his last quarter teaching. This was a very well organized and enjoyable art history class. You get to see the art in Florence you are talking about as you hearing about it, which is an opportunity that many people never have. Every week, you visit a different site and the professor lectures on a different theme, and on the works found at that site, such a church or a museum. It was a manageable amount of work: a lot of work, but just the right amount. I definitely felt like I learned how to write good art history papers after this course. Our TA, Eleanor, was amazing in teaching her discussion sections as well as helping us write our papers. Overall, one of my favorite and unique classes in Florence!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] It is a very well-taught course. Professor Verdon is a very engaging lecturer, although I think this might be his last quarter teaching. Eleanor, the TA, is extremely helpful. She has lots of recommendations about art to see and gives very thorough feedback on paper drafts. I had not studied art history prior to this course and still found it approachable. This course is a great way to see many of the iconic and hidden art masterpieces in churches and museums around Florence. You also learn a lot about Florentine Renaissance history. Enrolling in this course also means you get a subsidized day trip to another Italian city. My experience in Florence and understanding of my surroundings in Italy would have been very different had I not taken this course.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2022] AMAZING!", "[0.65] [Autumn 2022] Take it! You're at the heart of the Renaissance. It'll change the way you look at art.", "[0.35] [Autumn 2022] Take it. so worth it.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] Although Prof. Verdon is retiring, which is a massive loss because his lectures were incredible and we were granted access to important spaces, but if Eleanor remains the TA for this class than there is still something to look forward to. She is wonderful and accommodating and is also a great source of information.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] Unfortunately, this was Professor Verdon's last quarter, but this course was amazing. The experience of learning artworks (by some of the most famous artists in history) as we view it is irreplaceable, and Professor Verdon was so knowledgable and engaging as a lecturer. Plus, we got to see a new museum pretty much every week, so it was an incredibly enriching culture experience.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2022] best class I've taken at Stanford", "[0.15] [Autumn 2022] Only take it if you have a genuine interest in renaissance art. Because the class is solely focused on this topic, you may find it a bit hard to concentrate during the course if you have no prior interest in the subjects.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2022] Such an incredible class, definitely my favorite I've taken at Stanford. Professor Verdon is the most interesting person to learn from. I could not recommend more", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] Professor Verdon is a great professor and extremely knowledgable. The museum visits made the class extremely engaging. Eleanor is the best TA that I have ever had- she is brilliant and extremely helpful. She took an afternoon to go to the Uffizi with us and I learned so much from her. Her passion for teaching and willingness to help students so they can truly learn is incredible.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] I don't have much to say as Dr. Verdon is leaving and the course will clearly not be the same. \nEleanor is a great resource, ask her for help and do it advance so she isn't swamped.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2022] You must take this class!! Professor Verdon is incredibly knowledgeable and the TA Eleanor is so dedicated and knowledgeable too. I learned so much about art history and the birth of the Renaissance in Florence, and nothing is better than standing in front of the artwork that you are analyzing during class. This class is one of the things that \"made\" my experience in Florence, and it has truly changed the way that I look at art.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2022] Take this class, or one like it! The teaching is incredible, and it is an amazing way to experience all that Florence as to offer.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] Definitely take this class! Especially since you are in Italy, you have such a wonderful opportunity to study Art History! Professor Verdon is an absolutely incredible Professor, and Eleanor was a wonderful TA. Professor Verdon's lectures were very engaging and I am beyond grateful I was able to take Art History with him. Eleanor was one of the best TAs I have ever had. She was always available to meet with students, help us develop ideas for our essays, rework them when there were issues, and resubmit them when we could further improve them. They made a wonderful teaching team! Studying Art History in Florence will help you better appreciate everything around you every day.", "[0.85] [Winter 2022] This has been one of my favorite courses here. Our instructor is very well-informed, and he is a priest in the Duomo. Our classes consisted of walking around the historical sites/buildings for the entirety of the class as he explained the history. This meant going to museums, different churches, and other places around the city. I learned a lot, and it was awesome how interactive and interesting this course was compared to if it was in a classroom.", "[0.9] [Winter 2022] Very mixed feelings about this course, which seems to operate at the extremes of the best and worst of the Florence courses. To start with the positives, never again will you get the chance to learn in museums from a figure as respected and as good at lecturing as Prof. Verdon. What a force. The man is a treasure trove, and for that alone I adore this class. Art history is pretty cool, actually. For the bad... three hours standing in museums is LONG. Horribly long. It feels like Catholic school again with seven hour masses. The course goals are never clear, it's the hardest course of my schedule in Florence, the Renaissance is horribly boring. The TA is a sweetheart and very smart but inconsistent in feedback. Take it if you must/have mild interest.", "[0.45] [Winter 2022] take it!!! no better way to see the art florence has to offer, a really unique class opportunity!!", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] This course is a fantastic introduction to Renaissance art, especially if you are in Florence!

You will probably never get another opportunity to do this.", "[0.85] [Winter 2019] Professor Verdon is incredible. You cannot go through Florence not taking one of his courses. That being said, I enjoyed his Museology course much more. There were fewer students so I think it was a better and more fun learning environment.", "[0.0] [Winter 2019] Take it, Verdon is absolutely incredible", "[0.0] [Winter 2019] I would say that Christina is the saving grace of this class--she is incredibly hard-working, intelligent, and kind. Professor Verdon, on the other hand, is arrogant, entitled, and, at times, rude. He often says sort of sexist things: \"Ladies, look at [something materialistic about the clothing/hair of someone in the painting].\" There are interesting parts of this class, but it goes on for three hours in the freezing cold makes it hard to focus. It's a big enough class that it feels very impersonal, much more than any of my other classes in Florence.", "[0.7] [Winter 2019] Very good class, Verdon is extremely knowledgable and takes you to the sites to see a lot of the material in person.

I honestly would have attended all of Verdon's lectures for fun, and I really enjoyed doing the readings to have context for the lectures ( I recommend doing them first to get the most out of it and make the papers really easy ). It was a fantastic experience, Verdon does a great job integrating history, close analysis of the art, and cogent synopses of any relevant bible context. I highly recommend taking it!

The long of the short of it is\u2014 this class has so much potentially to be interesting, fun, and super applicable to the Florence study abroad experience; however, it somehow manages to be the exact opposite. The common nickname for this class was Compulsory Instrument of Suffering (C.I.S.) because there was not a single student who enjoyed these two hours of week. The professor says \u201chmm?\u201d at the end of every sentence, kind of like saying, \u201cyou see?\u201d only she isn\u2019t actually speaking to any of the students. She also is very condescending and acts like, because we are American, we must not know basic history or general knowledge, which is really frustrating. The students don\u2019t want to be here, the professor acts like she feels similarly, and this was just a waste of everyone\u2019s time. Overall, other than the TA Eleanor, who is the most lovely human on this planet, there is not a single good quality about this class. I used it as a study hall, but honestly, I could have done that in my own free time.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] This class is pretty boring, but make sure to turn in weekly assignments and start on your final paper early. Ask interesting questions during the class to prod the discussion further. The instructor this year often just went through class material fast and didn't leave time for discussion, so make sure to contribute what you can.", "[-0.65] [Autumn 2022] The course was not very well put together. Assignments were not explained well and grading was vague. Moreover, the actual lecture was not very engaging as it was not interactive at all.", "[0.35] [Autumn 2022] It is mandatory but it is worth it", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] I have very mixed feelings about this course. On one hand, I found it to be very interesting to think critically about modern Italian culture and politics with my entire abroad cohort. The professor was incredibly kind and taught a great course about politics, economics, and society. However, on the other hand, I found it incredibly frustrating that this is the required course of BOSP Florence. I would have much rather preferred to tour Florence and especially the neighborhood around Stanford than have to sit in the Stanford Center for hours every week. The class was interesting enough and the teaching staff was very kind and supportive, but the time commitment was unreasonable. I strongly encourage Stanford in Florence to reevaluate this course and the content covered. I hope they have a more engaging and real-world relevant class in upcoming quarters!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] This course could have been so much better, considering the fact that this class is required for everyone who is studying abroad in Florence. Minus a couple interactive sessions and a really cool tour of Florence from the perspective of migrants, this course consisted of the professor mainly lecturing and reading off slides. Not very engaging at all and I felt like I learned little. Additionally, the workload for this class was a lot more than the two units that it was supposed to be -- it in fact felt like a four unit class with the final paper reflection we had to do at the end. The TA, Eleanor, was very helpful and was very engaging when she helped teach the class during the laboratory assignments. Overall, just a class you have to get through while you are having a wonderful experience otherwise studying abroad in Florence.", "[-0.05] [Autumn 2022] This class is required, and for better or worse, the quality of this course is left up to the professor.", "[0.4] [Autumn 2022] Interesting take.", "[0.4] [Autumn 2022] Live experientially too! Make sure to see how the things learned in class exist in Italy on the day to day.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2022] I understand there is a lot of content packed into a short period of time but the nature of the class does not lend well to student engagement. Regardless of how interesting the material is, it's difficult to sit through hours of staring at a presentation. Some more variance within the class would make it a lot more engaging.", "[-0.15] [Autumn 2022] This class disappointed me. I had three main issues, each detailed below. \n1) The professor. As someone who is studying International Relations, and was also in the EU class, I was really excited for this class and to link it to my previous experiences at Stanford. I'd try to engage in class and ask questions, only to be regularly shot down, glared at by our professor, or have things \"dumbed down\" for me. This was insulting. I also tried to interact with our professor before / after class times and was met with coldness. Never before have I been treated so beneath a professor at Stanford. I eventually gave up and stopped trying. \n2) The content. The stuff we focused on this class was some of the broadest and least relevant content I've ever learned. Although the readings were interesting, class rarely tied into them, and instead we'd go on random tangents about \"Italians like Soccer\" or \"Do any of you know what Google Scholar is?\". We didn't once touch on Mussolini, or World War II, both extremely relevant to Italian culture. The content was not what we should have been looking at in this class. \n3) The workload. Never before, have I had a 2 unit class with this much work. Multiple papers, all requiring research and citations, as well as weekly readings and responses, was simply too much work for 2 units. This class should have been 3.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2022] It was mostly lecture-style and quite difficult to focus for two hours. The best, most culturally enriching experience was the Migrantour, and I think it would be very beneficial to have more experiences like these over the course of the quarter through this class.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2022] Take it", "[-0.55] [Autumn 2022] It is very hard to focus in class. It is 2 hours long and the entire time you are just listening to the professor speak. It is a very traditional lecture-style class that can be dull at times.", "[0.25] [Autumn 2022] Professor spent the entire class time reading off of the slides and assigned WAY TOO MUCH WORK for a 2 unit class. I had more regular homework for this class than any of my other courses this quarter. Laboratory classes are also additional time taken out of my week, so I am confused on how this course is not AT LEAST a 3 unit one. None of the students were engaged in this course because of how poorly it was set up and taught, and given that it was only worth 2 units.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2022] You have to take it if you're in the Stanford in Florence program, but it really is not a fun class. There is zero interaction and you just have to sit there for 2 hours and listen to a very boring lecture. The intent to teach us about Italian culture is great, but it could've been done in  a much better way with a different instructor.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2022] It was unfortunate because there was a lot of potential with this course and there is a lot that I wanted to learn about Italy and politics, culture and society. But the lectures were disengaging and unstructured and I don't think that most people learned much, which is unfortunate. The thing that I really liked was the Migrant tour and I wish that there had been more museum visits or some way to make the class more engaging.", "[-0.7] [Autumn 2022] It lowkey sucks. The actual lectures are extremely dull and there's no opportunity for real discussion about the important issues that we're discussing.", "[-0.05] [Autumn 2022] This is a mandatory course-- I would just warn them that it is very dependent on the professor.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2022] This class was very disappointing. I had high hopes of being able to learn very useful information about Italian culture, but I didn't walk away with much. In a class on Italian culture and politics, I'm not sure how we didn't discuss Mussolini and other major topics. The class was not interactive and the most engaging classes were the ones that the professor was not teaching (i.e. Migrantour, Lab Class on creating a survey).", "[-0.5] [Autumn 2022] Worse class and way too much work for being listed as only a 2 unit class", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] Make sure that you look through the syllabus ahead of time, as I was not completely aware of the final paper until quite far into the quarter. Additionally, pay attention to your grades on the assignments and consider taking the class CR/NC if you think your grades are not very consistent. Lastly, though on the average week this workload feels similar to 2 units, towards the end it feels closer to a 3 or 4 unit class since usually 2 unit courses are CR/NC and for this class you do submit graded assignments. Also, the MigranTour is a really great opportunity to engage with Florence/Italy in a new way!", "[0.7] [Winter 2022] Professor Hooper is very knowledgeable about Italian history, culture, and current events. He was very passionate about the topics and well versed. Lectures could get a little dry due to length.", "[0.65] [Winter 2022] I think this class should have been more discussion based than lecture based. Additionally, a syllabus outlining the breakdown of the class and a rubric for the papers would have been helpful. I believe the professor tries his best to engage the students, but he may be a little out of date for our age group.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] There's no getting around this one, I fear... Hooper isn't the most exciting lecturer (that's very kind, to be honest) but when he's in his prime as a conversation facilitator/interviewer the class can be very interesting. He also doesn't really give grades (??) and his feedback is a bit off, but it's a pretty acceptable class. Go in with an open and optimistic mind.", "[0.0] [Winter 2022] Don't take it", "[0.65] [Winter 2022] Great overview of Italy for breadth of knowledge of Italian history, context, and what's going on right now!", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Although I learned about the basics of Italian culture from this class, I think this class could have been greatly improved. To start off, the professor has used the g*psy slur numerous times, misspelled LGBT+ on his slides, and failed to acknowledge the narratives of Black, Indigenous, and people of color in his slides. I noticed that when the professor framed the current political discussions surrounding human rights (e.g. gender equality), he provided a very simple, maybe optimistic, outlook. However, I think a simple answer that resembles \"oh things are better now than the past\" to human rights issues is very harmful, especially since it mainly impacts marginalized communities (e.g. Black women in Italy), yet he does not even mention those said communities. Additionally, this narrative makes it seem like there are no longer human rights issues today that has current consequences. I would have liked it more if this class had a discussion surrounding Italy's violent colonial past and the current consequences today. Moreover, the weeks' topics should include the narratives and works of Black, Indigenous, and people of color in Italy (e.g. BIPOC migrants). If an instructor is including only the narratives of white Italians, then there is so much missing pieces to a story. \nAs an instructor at a very renowned institution, especially in a *required* class for the BOSP Florence program, it is imperative that you have to provide students an honest overview of Italy's culture, even if it includes the violent history of excluding other racial groups and colonialism. Although Hooper is well-intentioned, I would like to quote from a book called \"The Delusions of Care' by Bonaventure Ndikung: \"The opposite of good is good intention.\" Good intention is not enough to provide your students an honest overview of Italy as a lot of the students in the cohort are BIPOC and have experiences instances of discrimination on the basis of race, gender, sex, etc. during the program.", "[0.1] [Winter 2022] Unfortunately, this is one of my least favorite courses I have taken during my time at Stanford. I did not find the lectures to be engaging and recommend a reevaluation of having this be a mandatory course.", "[0.0] [Spring 2022] If you can, do not take it when John Hooper teaches it. The new teacher might be different though.", "[0.45] [Spring 2022] Interesting topic! Lectures were very dry tho.", "[0.65] [Spring 2022] Modern Italian culture and politics is definitely important to learn about. I think this class's lectures could have been a bit more interactive (eg. more discussion). The assignments were graded pretty strictly; often it was difficult to know what to write about and the grading criteria felt a bit arbitrary. As a required class, it's very little work each week.", "[0.8] [Spring 2022] It is a required class, so not much you can do. It is in theory a really great class to learn about contemporary Italy, however, it could have been more interactive and engaging.", "[0.45] [Spring 2022] It's an interesting way to delve into Italian culture from an academic perspective! Taking it with British journalist John Hooper felt a bit stilted at times (I think many of us would have preferred if it was taught by one of the several Italian educators at the Stanford Center) but his lectures were sufficiently interesting and the response papers asked relevant questions that provoked some deeper thinking on relevant topics.", "[-0.85] [Spring 2022] Would not recommend. Many times Hooper showed violent videos or images with zero warnings which was problematic, especially for a class that was required for us to take. Additionally, a class that was dedicated to make us informed of contemporary Italy would have had a much stronger perspective if it was taught by a native Italian. Course expectations for assignments were not clear, grading felt subjective, and especially harsh for a class meant to be accessible for people of all majors", "[0.8] [Spring 2022] Francesca did a great job as a TA and was very helpful with any questions I had about the course.", "[0.8] [Spring 2022] It was an okay course. Not my favorite one but definitely showed interesting perspectives around italy.", "[-0.45] [Spring 2022] It is unfortunate that this is required. I learned so much more about Italian culture in my actual Italian class.", "[-0.6] [Spring 2022] A lackluster class overall. The assignment instructions were limited and the grades were inconsistent in its rubric. The class was not cohesive and there was no consistent narrative structure to the lessons. Had the class not been required, I am unsure if I would have taken it.", "[0.25] [Spring 2022] It was alright", "[0.7] [Spring 2022] It's useful to learn about Italian culture and history, and Professor Hooper is knowledgable. However, this class is run more like a lecture than a seminar. The grading of our papers felt a bit arbitrary at times.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2021] This course is great and Professor Hooper is really cool and has a lot of really great stories to tell. Love learning about contemporary culture from him.", "[0.4] [Autumn 2021] Professor Hooper is such a well-traveled and interesting professor, it was incredible to learn from him and get his insight into modern Italy. It was a really insightful class in the context of studying abroad, because many of the things you experience outside of the classroom may be the topic of class that week. It is a really unique experience to simultaneously discuss things in an academic setting that you experience in your daily life while studying abroad.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2021] The course gives you a great base line from which to approach the country and the people--knowing the basics of their experiences and general views is crucial to deeper conversations.", "[0.85] [Spring 2019] I would say it is worth it if you want to be aware of the contemporary issues in Italy. It is more tangible and useful during your time in Florence, as opposed to if you just study the history. I'd say it has to be a helpful balance of both, and this class helps a lot with this.", "[0.8] [Winter 2019] It is a must take! Fascinating and fun.", "[0.95] [Winter 2019] Awesome class, Hooper is extremely knowledgable as he is an out-in-the-field journalist who writes for media like the Economist. Very interesting and a good primer to help shape your perception of the greater Italian cultural picture.", "[0.45] [Winter 2019] I highly recommend this course! I learned so much from Professor Hooper, and it's one of the only courses which focuses on Italy TODAY, instead of Italy of the past.", "[0.9] [Winter 2019] It is super interesting to learn about what is happening in Italy and the country's history while you live there. Not too much work overall and its a great lecture once a week", "[0.0] [Autumn 2018] The class is wildly fine. Hooper is a bit brutal with feedback but it's fine.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2018] Hooper knows a lot about contemporary Italy and is eager to share his knowledge but if you read his book, you may not find the class as engaging as you might want. Also be sure to read the syllabus, as the guidelines for the assignments are not always comprehensive.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] I really enjoyed this course! Would definitely recommend it to any student who is curious about Italy at a high level.", "[0.15] [Autumn 2018] Hooper is knowledgeable on the subjects, makes interesting lectures, and is a good conversationalist. Not the best class I've ever taken, but I did find that I learned things in the course that tangibly aided me during my abroad experience.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2018] This was my favorite course while abroad. The topics covered include political science, economics, history, psychology, and many more. There is really a topic for everyone. Hooper was an engaging lecturer that pushed for our absolute best submissions. It was a pleasure to work with him.", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] This is a crash course in the cultural side of Italy-you gain knowledge that you otherwise could only gain by years of Stanford Italian or by living in Florence for several years. If you're interested in cultural developments and differences, as well as the linguistic diversity of Italy, it's a really cool class to take. Hooper is incredibly well educated and European cultures overall, and he's an interesting guy to talk to. Take it!", "[0.65] [Spring 2018] This is an important class that teaches about some of the things you will encounter on a daily basis - immigration, gender relations, the arts, politics (especially relevant!), etc. It's really useful", "[0.6] [Spring 2018] Great course. Relevant material. Incredible teacher.", "[0.7] [Spring 2018] Great, flexible class", "[0.3] [Spring 2018] Take the assignments seriously, do not slack off and you will be in good shape.", "[0.6] [Spring 2018] A great overview of Italian culture that really enhanced my time in Florence and my understanding of Italians.", "[0.6] [Spring 2018] John Hooper is an excellent professor who is incredibly knowledgeable about all things Italy!  If you're looking to learn about the current social and political state of Italy, Hooper is the man.", "[0.6] [Spring 2018] John Hooper is a really knowledgeable and chill teacher (he wrote an awesome book called The Italians which you should check out). I feel so much more informed about Italy - its culture, its economics, and especially its politics - after having taken this class. The workload is very manageable.", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] Really fun and relevant course for your study abroad experience. Hooper is very interesting and an extremely competent and relaxed lecturer. You will feel better prepared to discuss Italy with your classmates and host families.", "[1.0] [Spring 2018] If you're studying abroad in Italy, you absolutely have to take this class. No other class could possibly prepare you so well to fully understand and make sense of all the perplexities of Italy. This class covers every important aspect of Italian life - politics, economy, culture, the arts, immigration, Italian lifestyle, Italian history, diversity within Italy, and modern Italian identity. The lectures are interesting, with excellent PowerPoint slides and oral commentary by Professor Hooper. The lecture on the Mafia (which we had in Rome) was definitely the best lecture of the entire class - so, so interesting!!!  I highly encourage students to ask questions to Professor Hooper - he is extremely responsive to questions in the middle of lecture. He is so, so knowledgeable about Italy that he can answer every question precisely and exactly; furthermore, when asked questions, he goes on interesting tangents, often sharing very fascinating anecdotes (some of which are from his own personal experience as a journalist). Another big plus - Professor Hooper is very, very responsive to email, so you can always email him if you have any questions. The assignments for this class were excellent. Some of them did a very good job of pushing us to make use of the resources that are only available to us in Italy - namely, Italians. For example, Professor Hooper asked us to speak to and interview people to learn about Italian identity and immigration to Italy. These were the most enriching assignments, as they provided us with an opportunity to learn something that we could not have possibly learnt had we just stayed on the Stanford campus. I also liked how these experiences pushed me outside my comfort zone.  We had a lot of freedom to choose a topic for the final paper, which was very nice. Lastly, Professor Hooper provides very constructive feedback on every single written submission - which is a great way to learn and improve!", "[0.9] [Winter 2018] I think that every student studying abroad in Florence should take this course! John Hooper is extremely knowledgable. He has had the opportunity to speak to many of the most influential people in Italy and is happy to share his experiences with students.", "[0.6] [Winter 2018] A great opening into understanding Italy", "[0.8] [Winter 2018] This is a great course to take with the migration and cultural diversity course, to round out the knowledge of contemporary Italy. However, while the lecture is fun, and the information is interesting, the instruction is not my favorite. It was difficult to plan for assignments as there were no written prompts or instructions. However, overall, very good class to take!", "[0.9] [Winter 2018] Amazing class, definitely take it!

I learned so much interesting information about the Mafia, gender relations in Italy, the economy, cultural contributions, regional differences and more. This course answered all the questions that I had about Italy before coming. It also pointed me in the right direction of where to look to find and experience interesting aspects of Italian culture and attitude that are different than the American perspective.I learned a great deal about Contemporary Italian history and culture. This class was incredibly helpful for me in interacting with my host family and local Italians. I learned a lot of fascinating information about the Mafia, gender differences and interactions, the economy, cultural contributions, regional differences and much more. Learning this information enabled me to have really interesting conversations with my host mom about her experiences in Italy over the past 60 years.", "[0.85] [Spring 2017] Take it! Easily one of my all-time favorite classes from Stanford. Very knowledgable instructor with so much interesting information!", "[0.75] [Winter 2017] This is a wonderful course, and a great way to learn more about the contemporary life of a culture that is very steeped in its own past.

Hooper was incredible and I'm so happy to have taken it. My favorite class in Florence!", "[0.8] [Winter 2017] A lot of work for a 2 unit class.

John Hooper is fantastic.", "[0.6] [Winter 2017] Do the readings, and enjoy the course! Ask a lot of questions!", "[0.95] [Winter 2017] I would strongly recommend it; it is a great, medium commitment way to get the lay of the land culturally in Italy.  It helped me interpret my surroundings more intelligently, and sparked some interesting discussions with my host family.  The trip to Rome was a particularly valuable experience.  Professor Hooper is organized, clear, and laid-back, and chooses relevant material to teach.", "[0.95] [Autumn 2016] Definitely take it!

We only learn about 9 recipes in total, and in general there is only one student helping the instructor in the actual cooking process at a time. As a one-unit class, it's fun, but I was hoping to be able to learn more recipes.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2022] One of the chefs yelled at a student for eating a piece of cheese.

You get to hear their stories and cook amazing food .", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] This is an amazing class! You get to go to a cooking class that would normally cost hundreds of dollars, and learn how to cook local dishes (and even vegan ones) from a top chef.

Enhanced my overall study-abroad experience!", "[0.0] [Autumn 2022] Absolutely undoubtedly a must-take in Florence!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] Here are the pros: you get to watch a chef cook food for you, where you occasionally get to help with some small tasks such as chopping vegetables or making pasta. You get to learn some tidbits of knowledge about Italian cuisine as they walk you through the process. This class is also only three sessions throughout the quarter, so it is an easy, enjoyable one unit.\n\nWhat could be cons, depending on what you prefer: I felt like I learned very little: both regarding to Italian food culture, and in actual cooking. There was barely any cooking done in most of the sessions by students. While I understand that it is difficult to allow ~ ten students to simultaneously cook in a three hour session, I felt like the sessions could be a little more interactie than it was.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2022] Great class!

This course meets three times throughout the quarter during dinner for 3 hours each. This class is hosted at a professional cooking school with one of the teachers there. Cooking and hanging out with the other students was just a really great time. Also, for those with food allergies or restrictions, they were always able to find a different thing for me to make instead so don't worry about that. One suggestion I have would be to make sure you eat a snack before or bring some with you since you'll be eating dinner a bit later than usual since you have to cook it first.", "[0.65] [Autumn 2019] Take.

Only meets 3 times per quarter and nearly everyone in the program takes it.", "[1.0] [Spring 2019] Definitely take it! It's a lot of fun and a nice break from regular classes!

It was relaxed and fun and also a nice three course dinner after class!", "[0.7] [Spring 2019] Do it! Fun introduction to Italian food and cool instructors.", "[0.95] [Spring 2019] this is an amazing class and making your own food before cooking it is so satisfying! occasionally it's a little disappointing if the chefs don't let you do all of the steps or that the course doesn't have much interaction and hands-on work (you're just sitting there while the teacher makes the food) or if the food takes a long time to make, but most of the time you get to cook and the dinner is delicious! i especially loved the meatballs and handmade pasta and i'm definitely going to make tiramisu at home!", "[0.55] [Spring 2019] Fun!

The language instructors at Stanford in Florence are fantastic. I learned a lot, following first year first quarter, and it's a cool opportunity to be able to continue learning Italian, in Italy. We also had lots of opportunities to learn and practice Italian in context, with different site visits and outside learning materials.", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] This class was very helpful for developing my speaking skills, which helped me in interactions with Italians outside the classroom.

There was a major disconnect between what we learned in class and what we were tested on. I did really appreciate the focus on conversation. I really hoped to master Italian while studying abroad in Florence, and I do feel confident in my ability to speak Italian following this course.", "[0.5] [Autumn 2022] Sweet professor, take the class for her!", "[0.95] [Autumn 2022] The content of the class really helps you grow as a speaker. You're a bit more responsible for learning material, as there weren't as many structured lessons as first year. Overall the professor really cares about how you're doing, is flexible, and really interested in bettering your language abilities which she accomplishes through discussions in class.", "[-0.8] [Autumn 2022] I'd like to start this off by saying that I love Fiorenza. The passion and dedication for this class is unmatched, and I found her empathy and love of teaching contagious. However, I struggled in my language acquisition. I think there were two main changes that made this hard. \n\n1) Canvas was not used. We had to email in our assignments, and we'd only learn about assignments based on canvas announcements but nothing would be posted / match the syllabus. This made things hard logistically, as there were occasions where we didn't know what we were being tested on, or emails would be lost, and so communication was a bit hard. \n2) Lack of textbook / learning grammar on our own. We wouldn't learn new concepts in class, and instead have to learn them by ourselves in between classes. Because we didn't really use a textbook, we'd just be sent a powerpoint to try and learn things from, or if we did use a random textbook page, we would have to google and try and teach ourselves the concepts that the worksheets were on. Because of this, I would regularly fail tests as I simply wasn't learning in a way that worked for me. I really struggled with this as googling and trying to teach myself a concept when it wasn't explained to me simply isn't the way I learn. \n\nDespite these two large things, I learned a ridiculous amount culturally. My speaking in Italian improved tenfold, and discussions on Italian politics, gender roles, and the North / South divide all marked some of my largest learning moments this quarter. Although I really struggled grammatically, I found that Fiorenza was able to teach a great cultural class in Italian, where we all were able to discuss and debate some pressing issues.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] Fiorenza is an amazing teacher and this course is very helpful in Florence!!

Even if you've taken a year of Italian, there is still a lot to learn from this class. The topics covered in this class are quite useful for navigating life in Italy. On the cultural side, this class teaches you a fair amount about Italian music, festivals, domestic life, women's issues,  immigration etc. all of which were very interesting to learn while I was in Italy. Learning passato remoto & trapassato remoto, present progressive & past progressive, object pronouns, prepositions and superlatives & comparatives were all excellent topics that helped me speak, understand, read and write Italian.  Giulia is a fantastic teacher!!! She does a great job of giving us opportunities to speak so that we have lots of practice with speaking Italian. She has a very solid understanding of contemporary Italian culture and does a great job of sharing that with us, thereby making class a lot of fun!

He did such a wonderful job teaching us major economic principles through the lens of Italian culture, history, and society which gave me a deeper appreciation for both economics and Italy. Additionally, he did a great job incorporating the study of data science by helping us learn how to code in R. My time in studying abroad simply would not have been the same without taking this class. Whether Brad is teaching this on your home campus or at a study abroad-- take his class! You will not regret it. It is also a great class for all levels of economics and/or data science/mathematical computational science students.

You have got to take a class on Renaissance/Mannerist art while in Florence. Florence is THE city for art history. In most classes, you go onsite to Churches, Museums, etc. to see the great works in the original form while Professor Verdon gives a detailed tour. This class is the best way to explore the artistic wonders of Florence. You see the Doumo, Santa Croce, Palazzo Vecchio, Uffizi, Bargello, and so, so much more. Verdon's tours of these great museums and churches is 100 times better than what you would get if you paid for one. Definitely my favorite class at Stanford in Florence.

The only downside are the essays-- BUT the TA eleanor is also super accomplished and really works with you to make you you get the best grade possible (if you don't like your grade, you can redo it!).

Verdon is a legend and nearly everyone takes one of his classes.

However, I didn't enjoy this class as much as I enjoyed the other classes I took in Florence. Professor Verdon is a very good lecturer, but sometimes it can be hard to get a sense of the main themes of the class when we jump so rapidly from painting to painting. I would also give students some advice: show up on time to all lectures, spend time discussing the work with the TA in Office Hours (Laura was an absolutely excellent TA!!!). I would also encourage students to start their papers early, so that they have enough time to do research and cite sources. Lastly, I would strongly encourage students to sit at the front of lectures and participate actively in class.

So does Laura (his TA).  Take advantage of her, as she is much more available and is thinking specifically about helping Stanford students.", "[0.8] [Spring 2017] This class is a really wonderful class to take in Florence because the lectures tell you more about the city you're living in, and allow you to be more informed when you're visiting famous sites and museums.

You'll learn so much from Professor Verdon and he is a very engaging lecturer who makes his points very clearly.

The lectures flowed incredibly well throughout the quarter and all the knowledge built on the foundation from the first few weeks so it was easy for me to situate my knowledge in a comprehensive way.", "[0.9] [Spring 2017] Professor Verdon's particular lecture style provides an energy to the lecture that allows the student to truly capture the importance of the artwork being described. Taking the class will help you better understand contemporary Florence by studying the critical period of the Renaissance that shaped it to what it is today.

Christina, the TA, is really good at her job, but she's stuck as the middleman between Verdon, who doesn't do anything besides the lectures, and the students who are unsure what's happening all the time.

When you're in class, contribute to class discussion - it shows that you did the work and have thought about the content, and it lets the professor know that you're engaging. It's film, so everything is subjective, and you can even pursue the conversation outside of class if you want to.

I did not have much interest in painting and drawing before this class, and I first decided to take it mainly to satisfy the Creative-Expression requirement. However, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Filippo is an excellent teacher and mentor. He is very encouraging and gives his students the flexibility and freedom to follow their passions when it comes to deciding what to paint for the exhibit. However, he also dispenses sage advice about how to paint and draw effectively, giving valuable advice about technique. Almost every aspect of the course is valuable - the paintings for the exhibit, the final exam, the boxes we draw and paint, the sketch of Michelangelo's sculpture and the painting of Van Gough's Starry Night. Another really good aspect of this class is the live models. Filippo arranges for live models (nude women) to pose in front of us for hours during class so we have practice sketching and painting the human form, just as the Renaissance artists of Florence did. Also, there is a sketchbook component of the class, where we make ten sketches every week and write a weekly reflection about the sketching experience. These sketches give valuable practice, and also give you a motivating reason to explore the great art works of Florence. The weekly reflection makes you a more thoughtful artists and observer of the world. In short, this course was absolutely awesome!", "[0.1] [Spring 2017] Ask Rossi directly if something is unclear or if you want advice.

I've been drawing and painting with acrylics for over four years, and so the instruction in the class was a bit basic for me.

Filippo's teaching is very traditional, so expect lots of technical exercises throughout the quarter (in drawing, shading, color theory. For the final you can choose to do creative work and you have freedom to paint whatever you want, so overall it's a good balance. The class only meets once per week, so really utilize class time to ask for feedback, Filippo gives really useful tips and suggestions for how to improve your work.", "[0.05] [Spring 2017] I regret taking this class - I wish I had taken a different art class on campus.

The readings are quite manageable and I can honestly say that I'm walking away having learned so much.", "[0.8] [Winter 2022] One of my favorite classes that I've taken at Stanford thus far. Really appreciated the anthropological and sociological lens that we examined race in Italy through in this class!", "[0.3] [Winter 2022] Sylvia is incredible, absolutely take this class with her if you get the chance! Even if you haven't taken a class on race before, she makes herself available to clarify concepts, and the class is always something I look forward to on Tuesdays and Thursdays", "[0.95] [Winter 2022] Highly recommend this class! This class should have honestly been the required class for BOSP Florence because it reveals a lot of Italy's colonial past and present consequences, which is not frequently talked about or talked about at all in other classes. Prof Yanagisako is a very intentional and warm instructor and the way she leads the discussions makes it feel like a conversation with a friend. I learned so much in this class! Please take the class even if you do not have prior knowledge on Italy because it's so interesting and some aspects in the class reminded me of the U.S. and how it operates. By taking the class, you will be able to expand your current knowledge of the implementation of racial policies beyond of what you know in the U.S.!", "[0.8] [Winter 2022] Loved taking this course, one of my favorite classes I have taken during my time at Stanford."], "OSPFLOR 78": ["[0.95] [Autumn 2022] This class is super interesting due to student presentations and discussions.

However, the lectures can be a bit dry at times, so make sure to ask questions and encourage participation early on.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] I adore Professor Baracani. She brought such a love of learning and empathy to each class. Content wasn't simply phrased as \"What is the European Commission,\" but instead modern debates and readings looking at the function, the structure, and its importance in the news. This extended to every EU body we learned about, as she emphasized us making connections to the US government, and encouraged us to think critically. I also loved how she encouraged us to keep up with European News, and we'd start many of our classes with a discussion on current events in the EU. Absolutely wonderful class, and an even better Professor.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2022] I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in the EU- know that it is one of the those classes where you get as much out of it as you put in. Listen to the teacher and work ahead of your papers, because they are very dense and will take up much time. Otherwise the class is not that much work for 5 units.", "[0.3] [Autumn 2019] Elena Baracani is extremely knowledgeable about the EU and Italy; make sure you discuss with her anything you're curious about. Much of the class time is lecture, but she's more than willing to discuss relevant topics in depth during class.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2019] If you are interested in learning about how the EU interacts with the world today, this was a wonderful course. Professor Baracani is really flexible to shifting the topics around issues that are meaningful to you, and it gives a lot of context for how the political world operates today.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2019] This is a great class for anyone who wants to understand the EU better. Elena is easy to talk to and always open to discussions during class. The smaller class size allowed us to have really interesting debates and address topics each of us were specifically interested in. The presentations and papers are a little time consuming but Elena doesn't grade too harshly, I think she just wants to know that we understand and are critically thinking about the material.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2018] Take this class, Elena is great and you learn so much about the EU. lecture can get kind of dry sometime just because its a pretty complicated subject but Elena does a great job of facilitating discussions and encouraging student presentations that really help to make the class super interesting.", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] Subject material is very technical about the institutions, could be more interesting. Good instructor but tough grader!

Be proactive with your work as well: I highly recommend getting started on the tourism \"final\" as soon as it's released in the 5th or 6th week, because completing it alongside the equally demanding fashion final can be overwhelming.", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] It's an interesting course, and I was really excited to learn about the topics.

The subject of Italian colonialism is rarely discussed in the US, and taking this class made me much more aware of Italy's position as a colonizer on the global scale and the results thereof. Mackda has a very conversational, interactive teaching style that encourages student participation and fosters learning while preventing the lessons from falling into boring lectures. We also got to explore Florence as a class, visiting and learning about local landmarks with complex racial, ethnic, and colonial histories.", "[0.65] [Spring 2022] Mackda is amazing! She is so knowledgable!", "[0.95] [Spring 2022] Definitely take this class. Mackda is super knowledgeable and receptive to what we want to talk about while making it relevant to the topic. I'm not joking when I say I learned more about Italian culture in this class than ACTUALLY LIVING in Italy. This class is important for *everyone* to take, it's a great way to unpack your interactions with Italians through an academic lense (with an understanding of Italian history, how it affected Italian people, and how it manifests through your interactions).

Research before so you are prepared for travel and social customs and can best experience the incredible city of Kyoto!", "[0.85] [Summer 2022] Highly recommend! Very well-run course with a good mix of field trips and lectures, reasonable workload outside of class, and lots of free time to explore Kyoto outside of class", "[0.9] [Summer 2022] Definitely take it, it's an amazing experience and a great way to learn about Japanese culture in and outside of class!!", "[0.95] [Summer 2022] Absolutely amazing program!! It was amazing to be able to travel to Japan and learn about the history, culture, and religion in lectures, then be able to connect that to the field trips and outside activities we did. Prof. Sommer and Ludvik were both great and made lectures digestible and enjoyable. We covered a very large span of history, so the course is kind of a whirlwind but it didn't feel way too fast, just a bit rushed. Highly highly recommend!!", "[1.0] [Summer 2022] This course is a great way to explore Kyoto's rich history and culture at a fraction of the price you'd pay to go on your own, alongside taking rich history classes and getting top-notch guiding from knowledgeable professors. I'd highly recommend this course for anyone who has any sort of interest in Japanese culture or history, given it's an amazing deal and comes with unparalleled educational opportunities. There's enough free time to do a lot of other things outside of class as well! \nDo note that 3 weeks is a lot of time, though, and that the vigor within a 3-week intensive program is not for everyone. I walked around 5-10 miles a day for the entire three weeks!

It gives you a basic but good overview of Japanese history and you get to go on a lot of fun field trips. Would definitely recommend applying!", "[0.95] [Summer 2022] I strongly recommend taking this course. The instructors give you an amazing crash course on Japanese history, up to WWII. It changes how you view Kyoto and Japanese culture. What makes this overseas seminar unique is that the instructors place a huge emphasis on field trips. All overseas seminars have field trips, but this course goes above and beyond. I don't think the trip would have been as effective if we hadn't had as many field trips and free time to go to more historical sites on our own. Learning about a historical site while it is sitting before you makes it real.\n\nThis is a life changing experience, especially for STEM majors who don't have the opportunity to take many humanities courses. The course changed how I will approach understanding world events. From now on, I will first learn about a country's history before interpreting a world event. I was amazed by how much the country's history influences its present-day political actions and international relations."], "OSPGEN 14": ["[0.75] [Summer 2022] Definitely do it. It is wonderful! I learned so much from this immersive experience.", "[0.9] [Summer 2022] Amazing course! It was incredible to incorporate visits to historical sites, museums, and galleries with the intellectual content of the class, and the discussions were some of the best I've had at Stanford. Tanya and Richard are both gems.", "[1.0] [Summer 2022] Really wonderful course that combines history with interpersonal reflection about religion and faith beliefs. Many of the students taking this course are STEM majors who want a change of pace for a couple of weeks, but there are also a handful of humanities majors who are taking this course as an extension of their area of study. Florence is a lovely city, so walkable, very friendly people, great gelato, pastas, paninis, rare steak, wine (and there are maps of past cohorts' favorites!). My one word of caution is for Christian students (like myself): be prepared for some anti-Christian readings and conversations. The instructors do a good job trying to balance out perspectives but there are still inevitably readings and class comments that can come across as insensitive, overgeneralized, or spiritually distressing. I was very grateful for the one other religious classmate in my cohort and found a good amount of solidarity even among classmates who did not identify with a specific faith!"], "OSPGEN 25": [], "OSPGEN 259": ["[1.0] [Summer 2022] This program is such a wonderful opportunity but definitely a work in progress. I loved Oaxaca, my home stay, practicing my Spanish, taking salsa classes, learning how to weave, visiting archaeological sites, and so much more. But the clinic visits were pretty boring and I often found myself just sitting in waiting rooms. It was largely due to the pandemic that things were slow and few patients arrived, meaning there was little to observe. It was disappointing to come all the way there and not get to observe much in the way of clinic visits or operations. Dr. Garcia was an effective professor with a kind heart and a clear passion for this course. Dr. Heaney always has good intentions and had a clear desire to learn from the local communities. Sometimes her rhetoric would fall short, however, and unintentionally cause harm to people within the class, especially FLI and POC students. Patience, stamina, and excitement are necessary for having a good trip to Oaxaca. I had an incredible time and met great people and consider this to be a formative part of my Stanford experience.", "[0.35] [Summer 2022] Recommend the experience specifically as an immersion program and to improve spanish skills, but if you are going to specifically get shadowing experience, do something else. The clinics are pretty empty and some of the doctors are not exactly friendly, especially if you are someone who is still learning to speak Spanish.", "[0.95] [Summer 2022] It's an amazing experience, there was some disorganization and miscommunication in the beginning of the course that had more to do with the partner program this course works in collaboration with, however, these miscommunications were vastly miniscule in comparison to the great deal of learning done in this program including fostering a greater connection with Oaxaque\u00f1o culture and understanding of the Mexican healthcare system, through your homestay family, historical site visits and encounters with healthcare workers in clinical setting. I don't regret this experience at all. However, there are some barriers in the program for students in need of accommodations at times that could be better managed, although, I do not expect changes to these barriers to be difficult to implement, I think the course was one of the most accessible courses I've taken, with instructors who deeply care about you and the program as a whole.", "[0.8] [Summer 2022] This is a great course to take if you are interested in community health!", "[0.95] [Summer 2022] This program was overall a great experience that I'm very grateful for. Dr. Garcia is incredibly kind, knowledgeable, and supportive towards his students. He has organized this trip for a long time, and it is very clear that he has created strong relationships with the programs and people we worked with in Oaxaca. He is knowledgeable about the community and about his role and position in it. \n\nHowever, if Dr. Heaney is the instructor leading this course in the future, I would highly advise future students to think about if they actually want to take the course. Dr. Heaney's knowledge about Oaxaca and the experiences of immigrants who migrate across the southern border was incredibly lacking, ESPECIALLY for a woman of her position (doing community health work) and for someone leading this program. She has a lot of learning to do about immigrant experiences, POC experiences, etc. and would often make ignorant comments that negatively affected students in the class. She did not contribute to a positive learning atmosphere.", "[0.95] [Summer 2022] I would highly recommend this program if you're interested in Oaxaca, the Mexican healthcare system, and factors that impact local health. You don't need to be pre-med to get a meaningful learning experience both in the clinics and in other activities and exploration. Oaxaca is a special place, and the program does a great job introducing you to the city and a diversity of its people and their lives. If you're mostly looking for clinical shadowing experience, then the program may not be the best fit. There were challenges with some of the clinical placements, wherein the clinics didn't expect students to come and/or didn't have doctors for us to shadow or patients to see. That said, these problems seemed to have been new to this year, and I'm hopeful the situation will improve in future years. The shadowing also still helped us understand a side of Oaxaca we wouldn't have seen otherwise. Overall, the schedule is rigorous and can be very tiring, with only one entirely free day during the program, but if you try you can find time to get to know the city on your own. Regarding instruction, the required spring course didn't feel as helpful for preparing us as it could have been, with limited information about what we'd actually be doing. Dr. Garcia clearly loves Oaxaca and is eager to share his knowledge and insights. Dr. Heaney has good intentions, but she sometimes made comments that revealed a lack of knowledge, sensitivity, and receptiveness to learn, which sometimes made students uncomfortable.", "[1.0] [Summer 2022] This course was awesome. Sometimes in class it can be kind of slow (and if the time could be moved that would probably help - a 2 hour class after lunch on Wednesday can get kind of dozy). that being said, the content of the class was very well thought out and practical. to understand the breakdown of the healthcare system better, i think it would be a good idea to print out blank flowcharts for us to talk about and fill out as a group in class / in small groups, because in lecture stuff can kind of get lost. (Also, know that unfortunately basically every class administered over zoom pretty much goes in one ear and out the other of the class). \n\nI also think more / most of class should have been taught in Spanish and that Spanish should have been spoken more / mostly in class in the spring.  It would be a good idea to have a portion of each class specifically devoted to learning / practicing medical vocabulary and phrases in Spanish which the students will go on to utilize during the trip. Most students know a great deal of Spanish vocabulary and grammar but lack the confidence / environment to practice before the trip, and I think the fact that we have a class leading up to it is the perfect time to begin emphasizing and demanding for those skills to be practiced (most students who are still learning will not speak Spanish unless it is explicitly required, and though people are sure to complain, everybody will be grateful). For these reasons I believe it would be better to have two Spanish speaking professors teach the course, to promote Spanish knowledge and endorse an environment where speaking and practicing Spanish is required.  Dr. Garcia's attitude, demeanor, and knowledge of the subject matter all made for a great combination in teaching us this course. Dr. Heaney had a great attitude, but her lack of Spanish and knowledge \n\nAs far as the trip portion, i would let it be known early on in the spring / in application process that those who are deemed proficient in Spanish will be rewarded w the opportunity to take various arts classes (naming the activities), which I think will motivate people throughout the spring to work on their Spanish so the trip will go smoother / so that more ppl will be able to experience the arts portion, which i thought was great. I'd personally like to have been able to do 20+ hours of arts instead of 15, because there was so much more I wanted to learn and I had such a great experience in every class I took.  I will say that while it is definitely possible to go through the trip with a limited knowledge of Spanish, the extent to which you feel like you are connecting with and understanding the community (which, in my opinion, is close to, if not entirely, the point of the trip) will be significantly limited. Beyond academics, you are given a generous amount of free time, and speaking Spanish almost guarantees the joys of personal agency you will be able to experience while on the trip. Again, this is not to say that that the program should be gatekept by all fluent Spanish speakers, but that there should be a MUCH stronger emphasis on ensuring that students are at the very least least motivated and determined to improve their spoken Spanish both before and during the trip.", "[0.6] [Summer 2019] TAKE IT! AND ENJOY IT!", "[0.95] [Summer 2019] I highly recommend this course especially to people considering a future in medicine. I think it is important to view all facets of healthcare and this program is a lot of fun. I became incredibly close with the people in my house and in the program, the Professor Dr. Garcia is a wealth of knowledge and although the summer is tiring, it is very fun and rewarding.", "[0.85] [Summer 2019] Definitely a worthwhile experience with a great teacher", "[0.75] [Summer 2019] the best 4 weeks to start summer! you spend a lot of time shadowing (but not volunteering) in community health settings, and your Spanish will also drastically improve if you're not a native speaker", "[1.0] [Summer 2019] Definitely recommended.  This is the second component to the Oaxaca BOSP program that actually takes place in Oaxaca, Mexico. Your day-to-day consists of living and eating meals with a host family, shadowing in hospitals and clinics in the city and its surrounding areas, taking Spanish lessons, and debriefing/reflecting with other members of the program. On weekends, there are trips to the surrounding attractions, coupled with work with various non-profit organizations that do work in the area.   The program keeps you pretty busy, although there is plenty of time to explore the city and have fun in a less-structured sense. This course is definitely one where you get out what you put in. Make sure to be engaged during the clinical shadowing-ask questions and be genuine-and keep your eyes open as you explore a health care system that is pretty different from that in the US.  Suggestions for future students: (1) Brush up on your Spanish skills as much as possible before you arrive. (2) Ask questions and talk to patients that you encounter in the clinic. I learned the most in the semi-casual conversations I had with patients and doctors. You'll learn that \"con permiso\" and a respectful attitude can get you pretty far. (3) Take time to explore the city and get to know some locals!", "[0.9] [Summer 2019] INCREDIBLE COURSE. MUST TAKE. The shadowing experiences I had in Oaxaca were like nothing you could ever have here in the United States. Try your best to advocate for yourself, ask questions of the doctors, and even talk with patients (after asking for permission) as you will find that most are more than willing to speak with you and you will learn so much about another healthcare system and about the sort of social and living conditions and upstream determinants of health that might be influencing a patient's health and treatment. You will learn so much and be pushed outside of your comfort zone, and may be slightly uncomfortable with some of the things you see, especially in the public hospitals which don't receive as much funding, but it will be eye-opening and you will see how much healthcare systems can influence patient care and can sometimes create health disparities.", "[0.85] [Summer 2019] You get an amazing opportunity to learn about the healthcare system of another country while experiencing the cultural immersion aspect as well.", "[0.65] [Summer 2018] Take It! The lectures may be very long and difficult to endure, but it is all worth it at the end of the program. It is something special and it cannot be learned inside the classroom.", "[0.75] [Summer 2018] Having the opportunity to go to Oaxaca and learn about a different healthcare system is an incredible experience. It opens your eyes to different factors in healthcare that may not be as widely talked about in the US, yet they are still important.

Dr. Quayson's explanation of spatial concepts and urban history is incredibly compelling and interesting, and being able to go to all of these places and do our own spatial analysis was very rewarding. Also the added fun of being in a foreign country and learning from that is always beneficial. Overall, I would say that the most interesting part was learning about the slave castles' histories and how colonizers and enslavers utilized the space to assert control. Would recommend this trip and class a lot, I learned so much! Also, 3 weeks is not too short and also not too long, so I had a good time.", "[0.95] [Summer 2022] This genuinely was the best course I've ever taken at Stanford! Professor Quayson went above and beyond with the planning and execution of this course. I learned so much about Ghanaian culture, urban studies methodologies, and Accra - especially since the course involved us learning alongside a few University of Ghana students.

Furthermore, the professors would pontificate seemingly without point.

Finally, on a more personal note, one professor behaved in a sexist manner towards me, disregarding my engineering knowledge and assuming that, as a woman, I could not possibly be a \"science student\", undermining my knowledge in front of the entire class and deeply disrespecting the highly relevant coursework I had completed before asking a male student to answer in my place.

But the disorganization of the class made the thought of sitting through three hours of Ali and Murat jumping spontaneously from topic to topic nearly unbearable. Nearly every class we had started late and went past the end time.\n\nI could comment on a number of aspects of the class. We had these final presentations scheduled for a Saturday...due to poor time management, we couldn't even finish all the presentations within five and a half hours. Like...I'm talking about maybe ten presentations total. We were assigned books to read that were...in Turkish (guess what? Google Translate doesn't work very well when translating books). Deadlines were unclear, planned class presentations were almost always rescheduled and, honestly, the discussions were highly theoretical and weren't nearly as applicable to our lives or the short three months that we were in Istanbul than I expected. As in...we didn't even get a basic overview of history before talking about complex topics like laicism or post-post-kemalism.\n \nOverall, I think this course needs to be much more narrowly structured, have rubrics for assignments/projects, include more student interaction, and provide more of a frame of discussion (including history and such).", "[-0.85] [Autumn 2022] If I could have dropped this class, I would have. However, it is required as part of participation in the Istanbul program. Murat & Ali lecture for nearly three hours straight. \n\nTo be honest, I lost a lot of respect for them after watching them let racist and anti-immigrant sentiments go unchecked. They did not press back against jokes and ignorance over systemic racism in Turkey. I believe this is because they too are ignorant on how to speak over these issues. It is their responsibility to educate themselves over these topics. They are too paralyzed to react when students express racist viewpoints and are ill-adept at maintaining a classroom experience that espouses tolerance and respect for diversity. In all fairness, we as students held a meeting to express these views, and our professors seemed genuinely concerned. I feel that both of them must educate themselves on topics of race and learn how to moderate effectively. They should read extensively on this issue as educators and men in academia holding positions of power. \n\nOn the whole, my classmates and I found the material on Kemalism, philosophies on nation-building and political science theories, very uninteresting and even excruciating at times. I wish they would have taken a more consensus-based approach to their course. I know that our teachers sought to have a lot of flexibility in our instruction, but the material never reflected our interests. I most valued our discussions on modern-day affairs in Turkey. I hated the abstract discussions on the history of political science. It felt like our professors just talked in circles about something with no relevance to our lives. \n\nSo much reading was assigned that none of my classmates even tried to attempt it. The burden of reading became insurmountable. Please be more judicious in what you choose to ask us to read. It was very frustrating when I took the time to do all the readings and then had no opportunity to speak my opinions because the instructors dominated class time with their own lecture. \n\nI found it really rude and disrespectful that our professors consistently arrived to class 10 minutes late and then proceeded to hold us over our allotted class time by 10-20 minutes. I also felt extreme frustration when I was told to prepare a presentation for next week only to have my presentation pushed back by a week. For others, they did not present for another three weeks. When you give folks a deadline, stick to it. People rearranged their schedules, stayed up late the night before, studied hard to prepare, and then you pulled a rug out from under them with no warning. It's disorganized, and I've never been in a classroom with no respect or thought for the student experience. \n\nI think that they are nice people and obviously strong academics (Ali is very funny), but their awareness as teachers is lacking and prevented me from having a better relationship with them.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2022] Very interesting although a bit loose in format. Some of the assignments felt unnecessary but the instructors are so knowledgable and you gain a lot from being there.", "[-0.3] [Autumn 2022] tldr; Our professors were extremely reputable academics and deeply knowledgeable but terrible teachers - it was difficult to glean clear insight from seemingly unplanned lectures, and disorganized classes disrespected students' time and energy\n\nAllegedly, the compulsory BOSP Istanbul course was supposed to offer insightful discussion on the formation of the Turkish Republic and its endlessly intricate geopoitical implications. However, a few New Yorker articles by Elif Batuman (some of which were assigned on our syllabus but not addressed at all in class) ended up teaching me more than ten weeks of 2 hour weekly seminars. First, this course was very theory/analysis heavy - most of the Stanford students did not come in with enough foundational knowledge of Turkish politics and history to dive straight into using this context to theorize about modern Turkish politics. So right off the bat, we were all extremely confused. The course structure did not help - each week, we were assigned 300-400 pages of reading but most of our class time was spent not inviting students to engage in conversation with each other about the texts, but listening to a disorganized, seemingly unplanned back and forth between the two professors that felt like they were 'riffing' off of each other, full of abstract terminology, unfamiliar historical/political references, and not a lot of room for students to interject with clarifying questions. The only assignment that I felt asked me to meaningfully engage a text was a presentation on a chapter of a book, which was assigned with a hard deadline. However, after preparing to present on the day of the deadline, students would often be unable to present until weeks later, because constant tangents and interjections by the professors would make it so only one or two of a dozen presentations could be made per class session. Our final presentation gathering was the culmination this blatant disrespect for our time and energy - the class came together on a Saturday for lunch and about a dozen fifteen minute presentations. Many of our Ko\u00e7 classmates commuted 1-2 hours from their homes early in the morning to be on time for this event. The event ended up dragging on for five hours due to technical mishaps, a late start, poor planning, and of course, endless commentary between each presentation from the professors. Ultimately, this course did help me gain an inkling of understanding into the crazy political events that occurred during our time in Istanbul, and Ali and Murat are clearly extremely knowledgeable, but overall this course was so exhausting to keep up with and sit through week after week that I feel as if I would have been better off if we had been required to take a different, more organized and focused course.", "[1.0] [Autumn 2022] Ali and Murat are wonderful and really impressive scholars, but the course was on the least organized I\u2019ve taken in my life. I did learn a decent amount and it complemented my time in Istanbul well, but learning would\u2019ve been easier if there had been much more organization and overview of key concepts/topics for the Americans students (a couple of times they did this, and it was very helpful). I think Ali and Murat far overestimated our basic understanding of Turkish history and politics. \n\nThe amount of readings assigned was also absurd for a 4-unit (originally 3 unit) mandatory Bing class and the cramming of the final project and exam in the same period was extremely stressful. I spent more time on this course than I have for almost all of the five unit social science courses I\u2019ve taken at Stanford. \n\nOne thing I really did like about the course, however, was the opportunity to collaborate from Turkish students and learn from their perspectives. I really enjoyed the final project too, which allowed us to go into the city, interview locals, work with Turkish students, and be creative. Another highlight, which I super grateful for, was the opportunity to meet the mayor of Istanbul (a day before he was banned from politics, in fact). It was a moment I won\u2019t forget, and I really appreciate Ali\u2019s and Murat\u2019s efforts to put that on. I felt like that experience alone made up for a lot of my complaints regarding lack of class structure. The course could be really great (assuming it\u2019s offered again in the future) if they tweak a few things.", "[-0.95] [Autumn 2022] Before coming on the BOSP Istanbul program, this class was one of the academic courses I was most excited about. Unfortunately, looking back at this course in retrospect at the end of this quarter, I am saddened to report that this has been one of the most disappointing and frustrating classes I have ever taken. Professors Somer and Yayc\u0131o\u011flu are some of the most intelligent, esteemed academics I have ever met, which is why I was initially so excited about this course. Unfortunately, their lack of accountability in teaching this course and inability to make the complex course material accessible to students was extremely frustrating and resulted in widely-held resentment from us by the end of the course. This course did not center student needs whatsoever and was a consistent source of stress, anger, and resentment among the students who took it.", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] Since the course is required, I don't know that I can provide that much persuasion, but I don't know if I would recommend it if given the option. Maybe a good class to take if you're looking for a class with minimal work, but not if you're trying to learn and be held accountable for that learning. It seemed like the professors would come to class with no plan at all and would just talk about things randomly. Additionally, the class is very much catered to Turkish students who obviously know quite a bit more about Turkish history- I was looking forward to taking the class and learning about where I'm living, but found that I was entirely swamped by really advanced Turkish politics that transcended the base level of things that I needed to understand to talk about the things we talked about. Also, the readings are so much that basically every student gave up on them by week 2- sometimes were were assigned an entire book to read each week for a 2 hour class where there was nothing holding us accountable to reading it.", "[0.25] [Autumn 2022] Class discussions get distracted very easily meaning a lot of content is not really talked about.

I learned a lot about contemporary Turkey through its interpretation of/negotation with its Byzantine history. Our readings and discussions about the transformations that occurred throughout the Byzantine period in art and architecture helped me connect to my surroundings in Istanbul. This class is a lot of work - there is a 800-1000 word assignment around every two weeks and Prof. Ricci requires students to adhere to pretty rigorous research writing standards, but I felt well supported. I do wish she offered clearer feedback on our writing - despite assigning so much and expecting such high quality, she often only comments on citation errors and trivialities like word choice in her feedback.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2022] The class is pretty hard in terms of work- the assignments aren't too difficult and doable, its just a LOT of work. But out of all the classes I've taken in Istanbul, this is the one that I learned the most in by far.

Themes in this class can be very heavy. \nI LOVED reading The Bridge of The Golden Horn and talking my classmates' ears off about it. One of my favorite memories of being in Istanbul was sitting in a Turkish German cafe by the Sishane Metro stop in November, reading this book with a cup of tea as the sun went down. Oh my gosh. It was such a great book. I really enjoyed learning more about the 1968 student movements. \nI really liked the chance to watch Turkish German films like Fatih Akin's \"Head On\" and \"Otobus.\" They were very trippy and visceral movies. I never would have otherwise watched. \nThis was a great chance to be exposed to the arts while on my study abroad and consider the representation of identity politics.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2022] Really enjoyed the texts for this course, especially the novels Bridge of the Golden Horn and Perilous Kinship and the provocative work of Feridun Zaimoglu on Muslim women. However, I had issues with the teaching style - lectures just went through symbols, themes, motifs of each text, feeding us straightforward 'explanations', to regurgitate in essays. I wish we were instead equipped with frameworks to interpret texts on our own. The teacher often namedropped theorists - Spivak, Derrida, Foucault, etc. without actually explaining their work. It would have been really useful to have read our assigned novels/films alongside texts by the thinkers that informed or critiqued them. Then, our classroom discussions may have been less superficial and reluctant. Also, course was pretty disorganized. A discussion thread that was supposed to be a regular weekly assignment was often not opened online until the last minute, new deadlines were often announced after the original deadlines had passed, essay prompts were often released weeks after they were supposed to be published, leaving significantly shorter time to complete them. Was a bit stressful being unsure what was due and what was not, or if our work was even being graded.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2022] Really interesting class that is super engaging- Turkish German relations are really interesting especially if you've been to Germany. The readings were all very doable and we were given enough time to really digest everything we were learning. Not a hard class to do well in and an easy class to learn a lot in. Only thing is that Mert can forget to post assignments and stuff which is kinda frusturating- we were supposed to have like a month to work on our final but he never posted the prompts so now we might only have like a few days which is very frustrating (same thing happened with the midterm)."], "OSPISTAN 80": ["[0.9] [Autumn 2022] Cetin is a wonderful teacher- very down to Earth.

If you thought Tobira was a big step up from Genki, get ready for another step -- the book for this class has almost no furigana or English. I really recommend getting the physical textbook for this class instead of trying to find a digital copy -- the physical version comes with a pamphlet listing all the new vocab words in each chapter along with their readings, and I would have been pretty screwed without this. Unlike in Tobira though, there are no English translations even in this helpful pamphlet, so a lot of this class is about getting comfortable looking up new words and figuring out what they mean on on your own. You read native-level material, so there's definitely going to be a lot of new words -- you're expected to learn to recognize 500+ vocab words this quarter (first 3 chapters of \u4e2d\u7d1a\u304b\u3089\u4e0a\u7d1a\u3078\u306e\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e), so I really really recommend getting on the Anki (ideally) or Quizlet grind to keep things in your head.

If Buddhism or Japanese art interests you at all, I recommend it!", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] Great class where you can learn the basics of Buddhist sculptures and architecture. Professor Ludvik is extremely knowledgeable and always willing to chat about all things Japan. Also a great opportunity to visit many temples and Buddhist sites in and around Kyoto.", "[0.3] [Autumn 2022] This class was cool as it allowed you to explore Kyoto/Nara and Buddhism through temples trips; Professor Ludvik is very knowledgeable in her field in what she does", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] Professor Ludvik is extremely knowledgeable and tries to make the classes as interesting as possible -- there are plenty of opportunities to learn on the field trips as well and she does a wonderful job explaining on site too", "[0.75] [Autumn 2022] You should definitely take this course!! It'll give you an incredible opportunity to explore Kyoto's temples and gardens through class field trips, and apply the concepts you learned in class in real life.

Fabulous way of taking it the history of Japan.", "[0.3] [Autumn 2022] Skim the readings to get the general idea and listen in lecture to not feel lost in the class if you want to get something out of it. Otherwise, the assignments are the most important part and you can do them without the lectures, j the relevant readings!! field trips are interesting at first but repetitive after", "[0.9] [Autumn 2022] I would highly recommend this course for enriching your experience of Japan and seeing the country in a new way. My experiences of visiting temples, and even thinking about Japanese beliefs, has changed significantly since the beginning of the quarter. Be aware that the class is more heavily focused on Buddhist images/art than Buddhist philosophy, or the way people practice Buddhism, though they are connected. The weekly field trips are great. The readings can be hard to get through, but you'll learn more if you do more of the reading. Professor Ludvik is extremely knowledgable, and sometimes she can sound a bit blunt when students give an incorrect answer or one she disagrees with in class. But she is very nice and always happy to talk.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2019] one of the best courses offered in Kyoto. The field trips allow you to see the depth of the city you are living in.

If you're interested in this topic at all, I highly recommend it!", "[0.85] [Autumn 2022] Culture and emotion touches all aspects of our lives, so this course will be relevant and interesting to anyone who takes it.

Pay attention to the syllabus for deadlines and due dates, and Canvas has all the information you need (you just have to find it). Maite is a really nice instructor who cares about monitoring your improvement, but at times the activities didn't feel very engaging/useful.

I thought I was going to resent that this class started at 9 AM, but I didn't because it was chill and interactive. We always did a fun activity, and when all of my other classes had professors talking for a really long time, it was refreshing to discuss with a small number of people. The charlas program really was one of the biggest highlights of my study abroad experience as well, and even though anyone can do them, the reality is that those who aren't in spanish classes often don't sign up (which is a real shame since the estudiantes espa\u00c3\u00b1oles are awesome and can give you insight into the real youth culture of Madrid).

The class itself is good but not super rigorous. If you want to more rigorously improve your grammar, for example, you will have to self-study through the textbook, which is not a bad reference. The assigned reading this quarter (2017 winter), Sin noticias de Gurb, was very interesting, if quite difficult.  The final project (creating a wiki website about visiting Madrid) is somewhat of a joke and doesn't really make a lot of sense in the context of the course, since you are writing the guide at the *end* of the course when you have already seen/done most of what you are writing about. Perhaps it might be  a good way to review and reflect on your travels and experiences, but it might have been more useful to do the project at the start of the study abroad program as a way of getting to know some of the interesting sites around Madrid and Spain.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2016] It's a very fun class, with a variety of different activities and assignments.

The activities are fun and there are not many lecture obligations", "[0.8] [Spring 2022] I thought t was a good course to help understand Spanish culture and we did a lot of activities outside of class which was cool. It is a requirement for the program but it is a nice class.", "[0.6] [Spring 2022] I really enjoyed the trips!", "[0.85] [Spring 2022] This is a required course for the BOSP Madrid program. The course objective is for students to learn about Spanish culture, and I would say it has a very strong focus on the history of Spain. I believe there was only one class where we learned about Spanish gestures and how to interpret certain body language. The rest of the class meetings were about Spain's history. If you enjoy history and learning about different cultures, this class is for you.

Nonetheless, it's low commitment and you learn a lot about the country.", "[-0.3] [Winter 2019] There's no way around it, this class is has a lot of work for a two unit class.", "[-0.45] [Winter 2019] The readings are generally more informative than the time in class although sometimes they're hit or miss.

Some of it seems forced, but ultimately was worth it.", "[0.85] [Winter 2019] This is a great course that teaches what it professes to: about spanish culture. The only issue is that the information gets repetitive ie. we learn about francoism and watch a similar documentary in the democracy class, and discuss the economy quite a bit in the practicas class. It might differ across quarters, but it would definitely improve the experience in Isidro gave an overview to other instructors so they didn't repeat what we learn in class.", "[0.85] [Winter 2019] Isidro is a great teacher, he makes the classes interactive and engaging. Procrastinating the work will kill your monday afternoon so watch out for that. He's also a great cultural bank, so if you have any questions ask him and he'll give you a good explaination.", "[0.2] [Winter 2019] I mean... you have to take it...  It's fine, didn't really learn much that we hadn't already learned in other classes or through our experiences in Madrid.", "[0.55] [Winter 2019] Isidro can be very funny and engaging in class, and I learned a bit about Spain's social and economic climate as a result. It's a requisite part of the program that can occasionally be inconvenient, but is ultimately fine.", "[0.45] [Autumn 2018] Ask any question, no matter how small. Often the most interesting aspects of Spanish culture are the ones that seem so absurd to say out loud (for example, \"Why does everyone stare at me on the Metro?\").", "[0.65] [Autumn 2018] I loved this class! Classes meet every other week. The homework assignment every 2 weeks are read 5 articles in Spanish and write 100 word reflections to each of the articles.", "[0.6] [Autumn 2018] It is quite unengaging during class but the topics are good to learn about in order to fully understand Spanish culture and history", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] This is required for the program in Madrid. It provides some useful information, but if you're interested in Spanish history I recommend taking other classes on the subject and/or exploring the subject on your own to get a more in-depth understanding.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2018] I enjoyed this course a lot, and appreciated what it added to my abroad experience.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2018] Not too difficult, overall lectures are relevant and engaging.

Isidro has a big heart and really just wants to teach you about the Spanish world but the culture class itself is boring", "[0.35] [Autumn 2018] Obligatory class-- try and make the most out of it and engage with the reading or in seminar if possible", "[0.65] [Autumn 2018] It's required, the bing trip and day trips are awesome! The class feels a bit useless but some of the readings are interesting.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2018] Isidro is phenomenal. Great, interesting professor.", "[-0.1] [Autumn 2018] The topic is not particularly challenging but you do get a non-trivial amount of work and have to attend everything", "[0.85] [Autumn 2018] this is a pretty good course, its required so you dont have the choice, definitely the hardest part was that it was from 7-8:30 pm and its honestly very difficult to stay awake and pay attention that whole time, especially if you have several hours of class before.  have to write little reading responses tht arent bad and a short paper at the end but nothing terrible", "[0.8] [Autumn 2018] Definitely do the readings as much as you can in advance and take advantage of the opportunity to learn about important aspects of Spain. Take everything Isidro and others in the class say with a grain of salt; every homestay is quite different and everyone experiences Madrid quite differently.", "[0.8] [Autumn 2018] Isidro is really interesting and a great instructor", "[0.0] [Autumn 2018] It's not a lot of work. Just don't put the weekly homework assignments off until the very last minute.", "[0.55] [Autumn 2018] A bit more work than you think but interesting", "[0.95] [Spring 2018] It's mandatory- don't think you have a choice! But I would try your best to listen and really engage with the material- makes it much more worthwhile for sure.", "[0.65] [Spring 2018] While it may seem like a buzz kill to have to take this class you truly learn a lot about Spain and it helps you understand the Spanish society better.", "[0.6] [Spring 2018] I understand its necessity and relevance but this class needs improvement", "[0.9] [Spring 2018] This class really grew on me as the quarter progressed, though it is what you make of it. Isidro does the best job of integrating what you read/learn about with immersive experiences throughout various parts of Spain. You will leave the class knowing far more about Spain than before, and hopefully you will be able to appreciate what he is teaching. Do not be afraid to ask any question or offer any critique of the class; he is incredibly open-minded and is truly there to make your experience as enriching as possible.", "[0.25] [Spring 2018] Class participation is important for this class.  Before coming to class, think about what questions and critiques you want to bring up.", "[-0.5] [Spring 2018] In my opinion this course was not taught as well as I was expecting from an intro to Spanish culture class that we are all mandated to take. Each class was a mess, where the homework and articles that we read are barely talked about or touched on. I think that I learned more about Spanish culture talking to my house family and Spanish students than I did in this class.", "[0.9] [Spring 2018] It's required, but also probably one of if not the best course in Madrid. Take advantage of Isidro's knowledge and kindness. If you have any questions, he always gets back to you ASAP and is super nice to all levels of Spanish-speakers.", "[0.15] [Spring 2018] Well, you have to take it. I personally wasn't a fan of the course. A fair amount of work in topics that, for the most part, I wasn't interested in. Grading is very subjective-I stopped participating in class because I realized it didn't matter. Also the Bing trip was pretty disappointing. We went to Extremadura (which is like the Wyoming of Spain), when the quarter before us went to Tenerife. Try to avoid going to Madrid in a quarter where the Bing trip is to there. Isidro was an engaging instructor, though.", "[0.5] [Spring 2018] Do the readings! They are the most interesting part of the course. At the same time, keep in mind that the class meetings don't have a lot to do with the readings.", "[-0.65] [Winter 2018] You will have to show up to class because it is a requirement but the readings are barely discussed at all and you don't need to prepare anything for class. You just sit there and talk about things you've noticed about Madrid. I didn't find it helpful but if there are questions you have that you don't feel comfortable asking your host family you could bring them up in class but honestly you could talk to anyone on the program outside of class so really I don't feel like this class is necessary.", "[0.0] [Winter 2018] isidro is the man", "[0.85] [Winter 2018] Absolutely loved it, instruction was wonderful", "[0.85] [Winter 2018] This class is required so I recommend taking it. There is not very much work and class is fairly interesting. Isidro is a great teacher.", "[0.65] [Winter 2018] Required but very enjoyable", "[0.4] [Winter 2018] cool class where you learn about culture!", "[0.6] [Winter 2018] Required. The class time is mainly discussion about your experience adapting to Spanish culture, which is useful and fun. The homework (reading responses) is a bit stressful, but does not take long and is fair", "[-0.65] [Winter 2018] The assignments were not super helpful; I got more out of the discussions (immediate feedback and oral comprehension practice too).", "[0.75] [Winter 2018] Class is fun and you mostly just talk about your experience in Spain... class meets every other week so it is not too bad", "[0.7] [Winter 2018] Most likely required, so just enjoy it. Isidro is a cool guy who knows a lot.", "[0.7] [Winter 2018] It doesn't end up being that much work. You definitely don't need to read all of the homework, just enough to come across something that you can talk about for 100 words. It's actually can't be a summary of the article; he really likes it when you just run with something and talk about how it makes you think about something related to the topic.", "[0.45] [Winter 2018] This course is not super productive but is required. The cultural trips are quite interesting, but it felt as if the tutorias were held for the sake of having the class.", "[-0.25] [Winter 2018] Have to take it, but if it was optional I'd give it a miss.", "[1.0] [Winter 2018] At first I thought I was going to resent the mandatory two-unit class, but it was an awesome experience!!! Isidro is incredibly knowledgable and honest, you only meet four times all quarter because each group is every other week (plus a really powerful day-long visit that included Valle de Los Ca\u00c3\u00addos for us, where Franco is buried), and it gives you a chance to talk about what you're observing/feeling but maybe not even consciously noticing (which is huge when you go to other countries, because if you don't link it to what you already know then you aren't going to get very much out of it that you can apply to your life once you return home). All the writing you do for the class can be in the form of reflections as well - just include lots of thoughts/musings about what you're seeing and you'll do very well. The language pledge is like 25% of your grade so keep that in mind, and the grading is a bit subjective so definitely try to talk (at least but at minimum) once each class!", "[0.25] [Winter 2018] take full advantage of what you can learn from this class, even if some of the emails/readings aren't graded, reading them will aid your cultural immersion more than you think", "[-0.25] [Winter 2018] This class is a giant waste of time, but they have to include it in the program in order to keep you accountable for the language pledge and cultural events. That's kind of all you need to know.", "[0.9] [Winter 2018] This is a great forum to supplement the transition to living in Spain; the activities were very interesting and the readings helped give insights about Spanish culture. Isidro is helpful and witty and frames the tutorials well.", "[-0.55] [Autumn 2017] this class is mandatory but it isn't too useful or compelling. the class has no structure and you just listen to the professor answer questions the class has", "[0.4] [Autumn 2017] Make sure to not breakaway from the Spanish pledge!", "[0.0] [Autumn 2017] This is a required class that consists of your adherence to the language pledge, short readings, cultural activities and the Bing Trip.", "[0.0] [Autumn 2017] Its required...", "[0.55] [Autumn 2017] Take advantage of the out of classroom learning opportunities.", "[-0.2] [Autumn 2017] You have no choice but to take it; beyond just in-class activities/assignments, it also accounts for things like the Bing Trip, your consistency in speaking Spanish, etc. It can be somewhat annoying and I didn't feel like I really learned anything, but I guess I understand why it's part of the program. Worth it as a whole.", "[0.7] [Autumn 2017] It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mandatory so you might as well enjoy it", "[0.35] [Autumn 2017] The weekly assignments aren't painful. Come to class with questions since they're largely unstructured.", "[-0.45] [Autumn 2017] Awful, grading is totally subjective and makes no sense. Could be an interesting class but not taught well and I got nothing out of it. Required. Should be overhauled.", "[-0.15] [Autumn 2017] It's required but not super stressful. Homework is minimal. Just listen in class to get the most out of it", "[0.4] [Autumn 2017] Great idea of a class but poor execution. Wasn't very educational or useful. Talking with Spanish people and your host family will teach you much more about the culture than this class.", "[0.1] [Autumn 2017] Required... really not worth the time but you have to take it. Even though Isidro says he welcomes questions about his grading, don't expect a helpful response. He pays little attention to each individual student, and spends very little time explaining how students can improve. He doesn't seem to care that much about the class or his students as a whole.", "[0.75] [Autumn 2017] Even though this is a required course, if it were not I would recommend it.

For me, the class ended up being nothing more than a review of cultural elements I had already learned about in my other classes.
